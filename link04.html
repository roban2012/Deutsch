默克尔德语演讲以色列破例藏玄机<br><br>

为祝贺以色列独立六十周年，德国总理默克尔16日展开为期3天的访以行程。她此行备受瞩目，原因是以方破例让她本周二以总理身份在以色列国会发表演讲，并且答应让她以德语发言。<br><br>

默克尔破例以总理身份在以国会演讲，是否预示着她将为以色列送上一份厚礼呢？<br><br>

根据以色列国会惯例，只有国家元首（包括“总统”和“君主”）才有资格在国会发表演讲，而此番特许担任德国政府首脑的默克尔在国会发表演讲，真可谓是给足了她面子。<br><br>

以色列极右政党“全国联盟”党的国会议员埃勒达德已经坦言，让默克尔以德语演讲令人反感，“我祖父母被谋杀前听到的话就是德语，行刑命令也是以德语说出……我因此计划（在她发言前）离席。”埃勒达德这番言论，反映出纳粹大屠杀的伤痛仍深植于以色列人心坎，两国建交多年也无法抚平这道疮疤。<br><br>

2000年，时任德国总统的约翰内斯 劳成为首位以德语在以国国会上发言的德国元首，他诚恳地希望以色列能“原谅德国人所做的事情”，当年，也有数名国会议员杯葛他的演讲。5年后，德国现任总统克勒为纪念德以建交40周年出访以国，他用德语在以国国会发言时也出现过类似情况。<br><br>

目前，以色列大约还有25万名纳粹大屠杀生还者，估计德国迄今为止向他们支付了大约250亿美元赔偿。只不过不少以色列人仍心存芥蒂，拒绝购买德国货或者到德国旅游。以国政府还禁止国营电台播放德国作曲家瓦格纳的音乐，音乐厅也自动自觉禁演瓦格纳的作品。
<br><br>
反观德国，近年来积极促进两国文化交流，还于前年向以国送上大礼，答应把两艘德制“海豚”级柴电潜艇卖给以国，作价12.7亿美元，其中1/3由德国政府补贴，可谓是半卖半送。<br><br>

此番如果默克尔避重就轻改用英语演讲，或许能息事宁人，但这种“斩脚趾避沙虫”的做法，却有损默克尔作为一国总理的威信。事实上，默克尔为促进德以关系而向以色列一方倾斜，也要承担一定的政治风险。她去年到访以色列时既拒绝探访巴勒斯坦囚犯家属，又没有前往圣城耶路撒冷的阿拉伯居住区参观，结果就遭到过巴方官员的非议。上月，以国总理奥尔默特到柏林访问，默克尔还为以国讲好话，强调以方有权以强硬手段对抗哈马斯的火箭炮袭击。<br><br>

以国《国土报》的一篇评论认为，德国一直与伊朗保持紧密的经贸关系，又积极协助伊朗发展科技和能源技术。如果德国向伊朗出口科技是促进德以关系的最大障碍，那么德国持续向以国输出军事技术，就是确保以国未来60年得以存在的最佳方法。以国国会破例让默克尔以总理身份演讲，是否也预示着默克尔将为以色列送上一份厚礼呢？<br><br>

Israel's 60th Birthday: Uncritical Merkel Gets Red Carpet Treatment in Israel<br><br>
SPIEGEL By Ralf Beste, Ralf Neukirch and Christoph Schult<br><br>

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has become Israel's staunchest ally in Europe. This week, the country has pulled out all the stops to welcome the German leader. Back home, though, many wish Merkel would finally speak up about Israeli excesses in the Gaza Strip.<br><br>


German Chancellor Angela Merkel has received no lack of warm welcomes on her trips abroad. The US President invited her to his ranch in Texas, the King of Saudi Arabia presented her with a small model of an oasis, complete with golden camels, and the Emir of Abu Dhabi deeply regretted that she had no time to visit his desert tent.<br><br>

But the red carpet treatment prepared for Merkel during her visit to Israel this week eclipses all previous receptions.

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert personally met his guest at Ben Gurion Airport on Sunday -- an honor that until now he has only bestowed on George W. Bush. Merkel then helicoptered down to the Negev Desert to visit the grave of David Ben Gurion, the father of modern Israel. There, she was hosted by Israeli President Shimon Peres. On Monday, Olmert accompanied Merkel to the Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem, where foreign dignitaries normally lay a wreath alone. "The chancellor's visit has the same status as a visit by the US president," Olmert's chief of staff told an advance delegation.<br><br>

On Tuesday, to congratulate Israel on the 60th anniversary of its founding, Merkel will become the first foreign head of government to have the honor of addressing the Knesset, Israel's parliament. Until now, only heads of state were granted that honor.<br><br>

'Pulling Out All the Stops'<br><br>

Although political visits to Israel are often enough characterized by some last-minute improvisation, this time every detail was agreed on weeks in advance. The tight timeline on Sunday, including her outing with Peres, was just the beginning. Kibbutz visits, high level government talks, and a banquet in her honor held by in the foyer of the parliament are all precisely scheduled. "They're pulling out all the stops," said a top German diplomat.<br><br>


On Monday, half the German cabinet -- another first -- join their Israeli colleagues for consultations. In the future, such meetings are to take place on an annual basis, something that has only been reserved for Germany's leading European partners.<br><br>

But over and above the details of the schedule, it is a visit steeped in extraordinary symbolism. Sixty-three years after the liberation of Auschwitz, the German cabinet is meeting in Jerusalem -- a milestone in the complex relations between Israelis and Germans. Pursuing a "special relationship" with the Jewish state has been a cornerstone of German policy since the days of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in the 1950s. Many Israelis, though, have long wondered if Germany’s public avowals could really be trusted. With this historical gesture, Olmert is demonstrating that he now considers the issue settled. And he is showing that he considers Germany to be Israel's most important partner after the US.<br><br>

This public demonstration of the new close relationship between the two countries represents a personal success for Merkel. The chancellor has made special solidarity with Israel the foundation of her foreign policy, on the same level as the recently rekindled friendship with the US and her critical approach to China and Russia.<br><br>

It's very possible that March 17, 2008, will mark the beginning of a Merkel doctrine which says, at its core, that Israel is a close partner on good days and bad -- even when it makes mistakes. Clearly, one of the basic tenets of the chancellor's close relationship with Israel is that all public criticism of Jerusalem should be avoided.<br><br>

Discussions More Effective than Criticism<br><br>

When the Israeli army attacked the Gaza Strip in early March and over 120 Palestinians died, Merkel said nothing. Even the pope called for both sides to immediately cease all hostilities. And Merkel made no comment when Olmert's government announced two weeks ago -- contrary to previous promises -- that Israel would again begin expanding settlements in the occupied territories.<br><br>

Even a year and a half ago, the chancellor refrained from directly displaying any unease with Israel's military operation in Lebanon. When the Israeli air force killed four UNIFIL soldiers, she merely expressed her "deep regret." Other European statesmen like France's then President Jacques Chirac vehemently condemned the incident.<br><br>

In contrast to Germany's relations with China and Russia, the chancellor is convinced that heated criticism of Israel will not produce a change in policy. She feels that internal discussions are more effective. Merkel maintains that the Israeli government listens to Germany's advice because it feels that it can rely on its special European partner. This also enhances Germany’s importance in the eyes of Arab countries, say advisors to the chancellor. This summer a major conference on the Middle East will be held in Berlin to support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.<br><br>

Her pronounced close relations to the only democracy in the region give Merkel a welcome bonus effect. Due to their sympathy for the Palestinians, the Americans see most Europeans as unreliable partners in the Middle East. Anyone who stands staunchly at Israel's side gains influence in Washington.<br><br>

Nevertheless, Merkel's policies remain controversial. Critics say that Germany is sacrificing its credibility among Arab countries. And even in Israel, Germany's policy of unconditional solidarity has at times been viewed with astonishment.
<br><br>
"It looks to me as if the chancellor defines friendship as not intervening," says Yossi Beilin, leader of Israel's dovish Meretz Party and one of the architects of the Oslo peace process in the 1990s. "That's not friendship. A real friend gets involved in the peace process."<br><br>

Even Ophir Pines-Paz from the Labor Party, who is Chairman of the Knesset Interior Committee, hopes "that Germany will play a greater role in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict." And Israeli Minister Yaakov Edri feels that "A good friend like Merkel can of course express criticism, even in a speech before the Knesset."<br><br>

Part 2: Germans Wonder at Merkel's Israel Policy<br><br>

In Germany, it is primarily Merkel's coalition partners who are muttering about her politics. For instance, Rolf Mutzenich, a Social Democrat foreign policy expert, complained that the chancellor didn't travel to Ramallah to support the moderate Palestinian government, which he says is also a "vital partner."<br><br>

Mutzenich is also urging a more direct approach with Jerusalem: "The chancellor should make it clear to our Israeli partners that their settlement policy is a violation of the Annapolis agreements." Mutzenich was referring to an agreement reached by Israelis and Palestinians last autumn that they would avoid provocations.<br><br>

His fellow party member, Martin Schulz, the head of the Social Democrat faction in the European Parliament, calls on Merkel to "speak openly among friends" about how the Palestinians are treated. "The joint cabinet session presents an opportunity for the Germans to voice criticism of the resumption of building Jewish settlements."<br><br>

Jurgen Trittin, deputy leader of the Green Party's parliamentary group -- and a man who is rumored to have ambitions of one day becoming the German foreign minister -- demands criticism of Israel's treatment of the suffering people in the Gaza Strip: "You cannot criticize Hamas, rightly so, for holding the population hostage, and then put a stop to fuel deliveries yourself."<br><br>

Different Avenues<br><br>

Even members of Merkel's own Christian Democratic Union and its sister party the Christian Social Union, warn of a growing sense of annoyance among the Arab states. The chairman of the German-Arab parliamentary friendship group, Joachim Horster, says that it is confusing for countries in the region when the EU sharply condemns the Israeli settlement policy while the relationship between Germany and Israel remains totally unaffected.<br><br>

There has been no open criticism, however, of the chancellor's policies from her main rivals in the government. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) has remained reserved. He also sees himself as a friend of the Israelis. "Germany has a special responsibility toward the state of Israel, to protect its existence and defend its right to exist," is how he put it in a speech just last week.<br><br>

At the same time, Steinmeier has clearly pursued different avenues in his Middle East policies. He has initiated diplomatic contacts to Israel's archenemy Syria -- exposing himself to a storm of protest from Jerusalem and the CDU. "The idea is to reduce the number of possible troublemakers," said Steinmeier in his defense, although his efforts have remained fruitless. Damascus has lost interest in a rapprochement with the Germans.<br><br>

The chancellor has not allowed herself to be put off by such criticism. She says that in addition to Israel, she maintains a good relationship with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Before leaving Berlin, she spoke on the phone with Abbas to hear about the latest developments in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.<br><br>

Cozy Evenings Drinking Red Wine<br><br>

Merkel's relationship with Israel is highly influenced by her years growing up in former East Germany. The Communist government rejected all responsibility for the Holocaust and focused on Communists as being the primary victims of the Nazis. "We didn't learn until later, and I mean this very personally, what the Shoa represented in terms of an immeasurable loss to Germany and to what extent Jewish love for Germany was rejected."<br><br>

Merkel's ties to Israel extend all the way into her private life. She maintains a friendly relationship with Shimon Stein, the belligerent former Israeli ambassador to Germany. They have spent a number of cozy evenings together drinking red wine. Even Merkel's husband Joachim Sauer, who usually shies away from any involvement in her political affairs, has also joined them on occasion. Stein was even a guest at Merkel's summer home north of Berlin.<br><br>

As the chairwoman of the CDU, she ensured that the party’s new platform embraces Israel's right to exist "as a Jewish state." This is an important distinction for Jews in Israel who are deeply concerned about the rapidly growing Arab population. And Merkel was the first chancellor to station German soldiers in the Middle East. Since October, 2006, German navy boats have been patrolling the coast of Lebanon as part of the United Nation's UNIFIL forces. Merkel said the mission was necessary to contribute to Israel's security.<br><br>

When it comes to international relations, the chancellor wants to further enhance cooperation with Israel. In response to a request from Jerusalem, joint development projects will be launched in developing countries -- even in countries in Africa and Asia that have no diplomatic relations with Israel.<br><br>

It remains to be seen whether these exceptional close ties will eventually lead to a "normal" relationship between the two countries, one that naturally includes both mutual criticism and solidarity. The new Israeli ambassador in Berlin, Yoram Ben-Zeev, recently experienced just how ill at ease Germans can be on the topic of Israel when he spoke with a group of journalists in Munich. During clashes with alleged terrorists in the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces had just killed 120 Palestinians, including many civilians, but none of the reporters asked any questions about the incident.<br><br>

At the end of the press conference, he addressed the issue himself. "I want to clarify that we don't need to apologize for anything." Faced with a lack of critical questions, he otherwise had no opportunity for a justification.<br><br>
