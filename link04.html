为祝贺以色列独立六十周年，德国总理默克尔16日展开为期3天的访以行程。她此行备受瞩目，原因是以方破例让她本周二以总理身份在以色列国会发表演讲，并且答应让她以德语发言。<br><br>

默克尔破例以总理身份在以国会演讲，是否预示着她将为以色列送上一份厚礼呢？<br><br>

根据以色列国会惯例，只有国家元首（包括“总统”和“君主”）才有资格在国会发表演讲，而此番特许担任德国政府首脑的默克尔在国会发表演讲，真可谓是给足了她面子。<br><br>

以色列极右政党“全国联盟”党的国会议员埃勒达德已经坦言，让默克尔以德语演讲令人反感，“我祖父母被谋杀前听到的话就是德语，行刑命令也是以德语说出……我因此计划（在她发言前）离席。”埃勒达德这番言论，反映出纳粹大屠杀的伤痛仍深植于以色列人心坎，两国建交多年也无法抚平这道疮疤。<br><br>

Attempts to build a multicultural society in Germany have "utterly failed", Chancellor Angela Merkel says.<br><br>

Multikulti in Deutschland, dieser (this) Ansatz (approach) ist gescheitert, absolut gescheitert.<br><br>


<a href= "pic03.html">普鲁士（Prussia）地图</a><br><br>

<a href= "pic08.html">文摘（战争和航海）</a><br><br>

2000年，时任德国总统的约翰内斯 劳成为首位以德语在以国国会上发言的德国元首，他诚恳地希望以色列能“原谅德国人所做的事情”，当年，也有数名国会议员杯葛他的演讲。5年后，德国现任总统克勒为纪念德以建交40周年出访以国，他用德语在以国国会发言时也出现过类似情况。<br><br>

目前，以色列大约还有25万名纳粹大屠杀生还者，估计德国迄今为止向他们支付了大约250亿美元赔偿。只不过不少以色列人仍心存芥蒂，拒绝购买德国货或者到德国旅游。以国政府还禁止国营电台播放德国作曲家瓦格纳的音乐，音乐厅也自动自觉禁演瓦格纳的作品。
<br><br>
反观德国，近年来积极促进两国文化交流，还于前年向以国送上大礼，答应把两艘德制“海豚”级柴电潜艇卖给以国，作价12.7亿美元，其中1/3由德国政府补贴，可谓是半卖半送。<br><br>

此番如果默克尔避重就轻改用英语演讲，或许能息事宁人，但这种“斩脚趾避沙虫”的做法，却有损默克尔作为一国总理的威信。事实上，默克尔为促进德以关系而向以色列一方倾斜，也要承担一定的政治风险。她去年到访以色列时既拒绝探访巴勒斯坦囚犯家属，又没有前往圣城耶路撒冷的阿拉伯居住区参观，结果就遭到过巴方官员的非议。上月，以国总理奥尔默特到柏林访问，默克尔还为以国讲好话，强调以方有权以强硬手段对抗哈马斯的火箭炮袭击。<br><br>

以国《国土报》的一篇评论认为，德国一直与伊朗保持紧密的经贸关系，又积极协助伊朗发展科技和能源技术。如果德国向伊朗出口科技是促进德以关系的最大障碍，那么德国持续向以国输出军事技术，就是确保以国未来60年得以存在的最佳方法。以国国会破例让默克尔以总理身份演讲，是否也预示着默克尔将为以色列送上一份厚礼呢？<br><br>

Israel's 60th Birthday: Uncritical Merkel Gets Red Carpet Treatment in Israel<br><br>
SPIEGEL By Ralf Beste, Ralf Neukirch and Christoph Schult<br><br>

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has become Israel's staunchest ally in Europe. This week, the country has pulled out all the stops to welcome the German leader. Back home, though, many wish Merkel would finally speak up about Israeli excesses in the Gaza Strip.<br><br>


German Chancellor Angela Merkel has received no lack of warm welcomes on her trips abroad. The US President invited her to his ranch in Texas, the King of Saudi Arabia presented her with a small model of an oasis, complete with golden camels, and the Emir of Abu Dhabi deeply regretted that she had no time to visit his desert tent.<br><br>

But the red carpet treatment prepared for Merkel during her visit to Israel this week eclipses all previous receptions.

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert personally met his guest at Ben Gurion Airport on Sunday -- an honor that until now he has only bestowed on George W. Bush. Merkel then helicoptered down to the Negev Desert to visit the grave of David Ben Gurion, the father of modern Israel. There, she was hosted by Israeli President Shimon Peres. On Monday, Olmert accompanied Merkel to the Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem, where foreign dignitaries normally lay a wreath alone. "The chancellor's visit has the same status as a visit by the US president," Olmert's chief of staff told an advance delegation.<br><br>

On Tuesday, to congratulate Israel on the 60th anniversary of its founding, Merkel will become the first foreign head of government to have the honor of addressing the Knesset, Israel's parliament. Until now, only heads of state were granted that honor.<br><br>
<a href= "pic43.html">挑战原文：环球航海</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic44.html">挑战原文：End the Slavery Blame-Game</a><br><br>
'Pulling Out All the Stops'<br><br>

Although political visits to Israel are often enough characterized by some last-minute improvisation, this time every detail was agreed on weeks in advance. The tight timeline on Sunday, including her outing with Peres, was just the beginning. Kibbutz visits, high level government talks, and a banquet in her honor held by in the foyer of the parliament are all precisely scheduled. "They're pulling out all the stops," said a top German diplomat.<br><br>


On Monday, half the German cabinet -- another first -- join their Israeli colleagues for consultations. In the future, such meetings are to take place on an annual basis, something that has only been reserved for Germany's leading European partners.<br><br>

But over and above the details of the schedule, it is a visit steeped in extraordinary symbolism. Sixty-three years after the liberation of Auschwitz, the German cabinet is meeting in Jerusalem -- a milestone in the complex relations between Israelis and Germans. Pursuing a "special relationship" with the Jewish state has been a cornerstone of German policy since the days of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in the 1950s. Many Israelis, though, have long wondered if Germany’s public avowals could really be trusted. With this historical gesture, Olmert is demonstrating that he now considers the issue settled. And he is showing that he considers Germany to be Israel's most important partner after the US.<br><br>

This public demonstration of the new close relationship between the two countries represents a personal success for Merkel. The chancellor has made special solidarity with Israel the foundation of her foreign policy, on the same level as the recently rekindled friendship with the US and her critical approach to China and Russia.<br><br>

It's very possible that March 17, 2008, will mark the beginning of a Merkel doctrine which says, at its core, that Israel is a close partner on good days and bad -- even when it makes mistakes. Clearly, one of the basic tenets of the chancellor's close relationship with Israel is that all public criticism of Jerusalem should be avoided.<br><br>

Discussions More Effective than Criticism<br><br>

When the Israeli army attacked the Gaza Strip in early March and over 120 Palestinians died, Merkel said nothing. Even the pope called for both sides to immediately cease all hostilities. And Merkel made no comment when Olmert's government announced two weeks ago -- contrary to previous promises -- that Israel would again begin expanding settlements in the occupied territories.<br><br>

Even a year and a half ago, the chancellor refrained from directly displaying any unease with Israel's military operation in Lebanon. When the Israeli air force killed four UNIFIL soldiers, she merely expressed her "deep regret." Other European statesmen like France's then President Jacques Chirac vehemently condemned the incident.<br><br>

In contrast to Germany's relations with China and Russia, the chancellor is convinced that heated criticism of Israel will not produce a change in policy. She feels that internal discussions are more effective. Merkel maintains that the Israeli government listens to Germany's advice because it feels that it can rely on its special European partner. This also enhances Germany’s importance in the eyes of Arab countries, say advisors to the chancellor. This summer a major conference on the Middle East will be held in Berlin to support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.<br><br>

Her pronounced close relations to the only democracy in the region give Merkel a welcome bonus effect. Due to their sympathy for the Palestinians, the Americans see most Europeans as unreliable partners in the Middle East. Anyone who stands staunchly at Israel's side gains influence in Washington.<br><br>

Nevertheless, Merkel's policies remain controversial. Critics say that Germany is sacrificing its credibility among Arab countries. And even in Israel, Germany's policy of unconditional solidarity has at times been viewed with astonishment.
<br><br>
"It looks to me as if the chancellor defines friendship as not intervening," says Yossi Beilin, leader of Israel's dovish Meretz Party and one of the architects of the Oslo peace process in the 1990s. "That's not friendship. A real friend gets involved in the peace process."<br><br>

Even Ophir Pines-Paz from the Labor Party, who is Chairman of the Knesset Interior Committee, hopes "that Germany will play a greater role in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict." And Israeli Minister Yaakov Edri feels that "A good friend like Merkel can of course express criticism, even in a speech before the Knesset."<br><br>

Part 2: Germans Wonder at Merkel's Israel Policy<br><br>

In Germany, it is primarily Merkel's coalition partners who are muttering about her politics. For instance, Rolf Mutzenich, a Social Democrat foreign policy expert, complained that the chancellor didn't travel to Ramallah to support the moderate Palestinian government, which he says is also a "vital partner."<br><br>

Mutzenich is also urging a more direct approach with Jerusalem: "The chancellor should make it clear to our Israeli partners that their settlement policy is a violation of the Annapolis agreements." Mutzenich was referring to an agreement reached by Israelis and Palestinians last autumn that they would avoid provocations.<br><br>

His fellow party member, Martin Schulz, the head of the Social Democrat faction in the European Parliament, calls on Merkel to "speak openly among friends" about how the Palestinians are treated. "The joint cabinet session presents an opportunity for the Germans to voice criticism of the resumption of building Jewish settlements."<br><br>

Jurgen Trittin, deputy leader of the Green Party's parliamentary group -- and a man who is rumored to have ambitions of one day becoming the German foreign minister -- demands criticism of Israel's treatment of the suffering people in the Gaza Strip: "You cannot criticize Hamas, rightly so, for holding the population hostage, and then put a stop to fuel deliveries yourself."<br><br>
<a href= "pic100.html">爱（Was du liebst, lass frei）</a><br><br>
Different Avenues<br><br>

Even members of Merkel's own Christian Democratic Union and its sister party the Christian Social Union, warn of a growing sense of annoyance among the Arab states. The chairman of the German-Arab parliamentary friendship group, Joachim Horster, says that it is confusing for countries in the region when the EU sharply condemns the Israeli settlement policy while the relationship between Germany and Israel remains totally unaffected.<br><br>

There has been no open criticism, however, of the chancellor's policies from her main rivals in the government. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) has remained reserved. He also sees himself as a friend of the Israelis. "Germany has a special responsibility toward the state of Israel, to protect its existence and defend its right to exist," is how he put it in a speech just last week.<br><br>

At the same time, Steinmeier has clearly pursued different avenues in his Middle East policies. He has initiated diplomatic contacts to Israel's archenemy Syria -- exposing himself to a storm of protest from Jerusalem and the CDU. "The idea is to reduce the number of possible troublemakers," said Steinmeier in his defense, although his efforts have remained fruitless. Damascus has lost interest in a rapprochement with the Germans.<br><br>

The chancellor has not allowed herself to be put off by such criticism. She says that in addition to Israel, she maintains a good relationship with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Before leaving Berlin, she spoke on the phone with Abbas to hear about the latest developments in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.<br><br>

Cozy Evenings Drinking Red Wine<br><br>

Merkel's relationship with Israel is highly influenced by her years growing up in former East Germany. The Communist government rejected all responsibility for the Holocaust and focused on Communists as being the primary victims of the Nazis. "We didn't learn until later, and I mean this very personally, what the Shoa represented in terms of an immeasurable loss to Germany and to what extent Jewish love for Germany was rejected."<br><br>

Merkel's ties to Israel extend all the way into her private life. She maintains a friendly relationship with Shimon Stein, the belligerent former Israeli ambassador to Germany. They have spent a number of cozy evenings together drinking red wine. Even Merkel's husband Joachim Sauer, who usually shies away from any involvement in her political affairs, has also joined them on occasion. Stein was even a guest at Merkel's summer home north of Berlin.<br><br>

As the chairwoman of the CDU, she ensured that the party’s new platform embraces Israel's right to exist "as a Jewish state." This is an important distinction for Jews in Israel who are deeply concerned about the rapidly growing Arab population. And Merkel was the first chancellor to station German soldiers in the Middle East. Since October, 2006, German navy boats have been patrolling the coast of Lebanon as part of the United Nation's UNIFIL forces. Merkel said the mission was necessary to contribute to Israel's security.<br><br>

When it comes to international relations, the chancellor wants to further enhance cooperation with Israel. In response to a request from Jerusalem, joint development projects will be launched in developing countries -- even in countries in Africa and Asia that have no diplomatic relations with Israel.<br><br>

It remains to be seen whether these exceptional close ties will eventually lead to a "normal" relationship between the two countries, one that naturally includes both mutual criticism and solidarity. The new Israeli ambassador in Berlin, Yoram Ben-Zeev, recently experienced just how ill at ease Germans can be on the topic of Israel when he spoke with a group of journalists in Munich. During clashes with alleged terrorists in the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces had just killed 120 Palestinians, including many civilians, but none of the reporters asked any questions about the incident.<br><br>

At the end of the press conference, he addressed the issue himself. "I want to clarify that we don't need to apologize for anything." Faced with a lack of critical questions, he otherwise had no opportunity for a justification.<br><br>

中华人民共和国国务院新闻办公室<br><br>

2014年6月<br><br>

目录<br><br>

前言<br><br>

一、香港顺利回归祖国的历程<br><br>

二、特别行政区制度在香港的确立<br><br>

三、香港特别行政区各项事业取得全面进步<br><br>

四、中央政府全力支持香港特别行政区繁荣发展<br><br>

五、全面准确理解和贯彻“一国两制”方针政策<br><br>

结束语<br><br>

附录<br><br>

前言<br><br>

“一个国家，两种制度”是中国政府为实现国家和平统一而提出的基本国策。按照“一国两制”方针，中国政府通过与英国政府的外交谈判成功解决历史遗留的香港问题，于1997年7月1日对香港恢复行使主权，实现了长期以来中国人民收回香港的共同愿望。香港从此摆脱殖民统治，回到祖国怀抱，走上了与祖国内地优势互补、共同发展的宽广道路。<br><br>

香港回归祖国后，“一国两制”由科学构想变成生动现实。中央政府严格按照香港基本法办事，认真履行宪制责任，坚定支持香港特别行政区行政长官和政府依法施政；香港特别行政区依法实行高度自治，享有行政管理权、立法权、独立的司法权和终审权，继续保持原有的资本主义制度和生活方式不变，法律基本不变，继续保持繁荣稳定，各项事业全面发展。“一国两制”在香港日益深入人心，得到包括香港同胞在内的全国人民的衷心拥护和国际社会的广泛好评。<br><br>

“一国两制”作为一项新生事物，需要在实践中不断探索、开拓前进。回顾总结“一国两制”在香港特别行政区的实践历程，全面准确地理解和贯彻“一国两制”方针政策, 有利于维护国家主权、安全和发展利益，有利于保持香港长期繁荣稳定，有利于继续推动“一国两制”实践沿着正确的轨道向前发展。<br><br>

一、香港顺利回归祖国的历程<br><br>

20世纪80年代初，为实现国家和平统一，国家领导人邓小平创造性地提出了“一国两制”的科学构想，并首先用于解决香港问题。按照邓小平的论述，“一国两制”是指在一个中国的前提下，国家的主体坚持社会主义制度，香港、澳门、台湾保持原有的资本主义制度长期不变。
<br><br>
1982年12月4日，第五届全国人民代表大会第五次会议通过并公布施行的《中华人民共和国宪法》第三十一条规定：国家在必要时得设立特别行政区。在特别行政区内实行的制度按照具体情况由全国人民代表大会以法律规定。这体现了“一国两制”构想，为中国政府在实现国家和平统一时，在某些区域设立实行不同于内地的制度和政策的特别行政区提供了直接的宪法依据。在经过深入的调查研究后，1983年初，中国政府就解决香港问题形成了十二条基本方针政策。“十二条”包括：1.中国政府决定于1997年7月1日对香港地区恢复行使主权。2.恢复行使主权后，根据宪法第三十一条规定，在香港设立特别行政区，直辖于中央人民政府，享有高度自治权。3.特别行政区享有立法权，有独立的司法权和终审权。现行的法律、法令、条例基本不变。4.特别行政区政府由当地人组成。主要官员在当地通过选举或协商产生，由中央人民政府委任。原香港政府各部门的公务、警务人员可予留任。特别行政区各机构也可聘请英国及其他外籍人士担任顾问。5.现行的社会、经济制度不变，生活方式不变。保障言论、出版、集会、结社、旅行、迁徙、通信自由和宗教信仰自由。私人财产、企业所有权、合法继承权以及外来投资均受法律保护。6.香港特别行政区仍为自由港和独立关税地区。7.保持金融中心地位，继续开放外汇、黄金、证券、期货等市场，资金进出自由，港币照常流通，自由兑换。8.特别行政区财政保持独立。9.特别行政区可同英国建立互惠经济关系。英国在香港的经济利益将得到照顾。10.特别行政区可以“中国香港”的名义，单独地同世界各国、各地区以及有关国际组织保持和发展经济、文化关系，签订协议。特别行政区政府可自行签发出入香港的旅行证件。11.特别行政区的社会治安由特别行政区政府负责。12.上述方针政策，由全国人民代表大会以香港特别行政区基本法规定之，50年不变。<br><br>

1982年9月24日，邓小平会见来访的英国首相撒切尔夫人，阐明了中国政府对香港问题的基本立场，指出主权问题不是一个可以讨论的问题，1997年中国将收回香港。在这个前提下，中英两国磋商解决香港如何过渡得好以及15年后香港怎么办的问题。这标志着中英关于香港问题的谈判拉开序幕。1984年12月19日，中英两国政府经过22轮谈判后，在北京正式签署《中华人民共和国政府和大不列颠及北爱尔兰联合王国政府关于香港问题的联合声明》，确认中华人民共和国政府于1997年7月1日对香港恢复行使主权。中国政府还在联合声明中阐明以“十二条”为核心内容的对香港的基本方针政策。中英联合声明的签署，标志着香港进入回归祖国前的过渡期。在13年的过渡期内，中国政府坚定不移地遵循“一国两制”方针政策，紧紧依靠香港同胞，坚决排除各种干扰，有条不紊地推进对香港恢复行使主权的各项准备工作。
<br><br>
1985年4月10日，第六届全国人大第三次会议决定成立中华人民共和国香港特别行政区基本法起草委员会，负责起草香港基本法。同年7月起草委员会开始工作，1990年2月完成起草任务，历时四年零八个月。香港基本法的起草过程高度民主、开放，广大香港同胞积极参与起草工作。在起草委员会59名委员中，来自香港各方面的人士有23名。起草委员会还委托香港委员在香港成立由180位各界人士组成的基本法咨询委员会，广泛收集香港社会各界的意见和建议。1988年4月，起草委员会公布香港基本法（草案）征求意见稿；1989年2月，全国人大常委会公布香港基本法（草案），先后两次在香港和内地广泛征求意见。香港和内地社会各界人士踊跃参与讨论，其中，仅香港人士就提出近8万份意见和建议。香港基本法体现了包括香港同胞在内的全体中国人民的共同意志，凝聚了广大中华儿女的集体智慧。
<br><br>
1990年4月4日，第七届全国人大第三次会议通过《中华人民共和国香港特别行政区基本法》，同时作出设立香港特别行政区的决定。香港基本法是根据宪法制定的基本法律，规定了在香港特别行政区实行的制度和政策，是“一国两制”方针政策的法律化、制度化，为“一国两制”在香港特别行政区的实践提供了法律保障。邓小平高度评价香港基本法，称它是“具有历史意义和国际意义的法律”，是“具有创造性的杰作”。
<br><br>
香港基本法颁布后，中国政府着手筹备成立香港特别行政区的工作。1993年7月，全国人大常委会设立香港特别行政区筹备委员会预备工作委员会（预委会）；1996年1月，全国人民代表大会香港特别行政区筹备委员会（筹委会）成立。预委会和筹委会为实现香港平稳过渡和政权顺利交接做了大量工作。<br><br>

1997年7月1日，中国政府对香港恢复行使主权，香港特别行政区成立，基本法开始实施。香港进入了“一国两制”、“港人治港”、高度自治的历史新纪元。作为祖国大家庭的一分子，香港同胞与内地民众共享伟大祖国的尊严与荣耀，共担中华民族伟大复兴的责任和使命。
<br><br>
二、特别行政区制度在香港的确立<br><br>

宪法和香港基本法规定的特别行政区制度是国家对某些区域采取的特殊管理制度。在这一制度下，中央拥有对香港特别行政区的全面管治权，既包括中央直接行使的权力，也包括授权香港特别行政区依法实行高度自治。对于香港特别行政区的高度自治权，中央具有监督权力。
<br><br>
（一）中央依法直接行使管治权<br><br>

根据宪法和香港基本法的规定，中央直接行使对香港特别行政区管治权的权力主体包括全国人民代表大会及其常委会、国家主席、中央人民政府、中央军事委员会。全国人大决定香港特别行政区的设立，制定香港基本法以规定在香港特别行政区实行的制度，并拥有基本法的修改权。全国人大常委会拥有香港基本法的解释权，对香港特别行政区行政长官产生办法和立法会产生办法修改的决定权，对香港特别行政区立法机关制定的法律的监督权，对香港特别行政区进入紧急状态的决定权，以及向香港特别行政区作出新授权的权力。香港特别行政区直辖于中央人民政府，行政长官向中央人民政府负责，中央人民政府拥有任命行政长官和主要官员、依法管理与香港特别行政区有关的外交事务、向行政长官发出指令的权力。中央军事委员会领导香港驻军，履行防务职责，等等。中央依法履行宪法和香港基本法赋予的全面管治权和宪制责任，有效管治香港特别行政区。<br><br>

――组建香港特别行政区政权机关。回归前夕，香港特别行政区筹备委员会完成组建香港特别行政区第一届政府推选委员会，推选委员会选举董建华为香港特别行政区第一任行政长官人选，随后中央人民政府任命其为特别行政区首任行政长官；推选委员会还选举产生临时立法会议员；首任行政长官董建华任命终审法院法官和高等法院首席法官。上述工作的完成，确保了中央在香港特别行政区成立时即实施有效管治。香港回归后，中央人民政府先后任命经选举产生的行政长官人选董建华、曾荫权、梁振英为第二至第四任行政长官，还任免了历届香港特别行政区政府主要官员。国家领导人出席行政长官和政府主要官员就职典礼并监督他们宣誓。
<br><br>
――支持指导香港特别行政区行政长官和政府依法施政。行政长官每年向中央政府述职，报告基本法贯彻执行情况等须向中央政府负责的事项，国家领导人就贯彻落实基本法的重大事项对行政长官予以指导。中央政府设立国务院港澳事务办公室作为国务院处理港澳事务的办事机构，负责贯彻执行“一国两制”方针政策和中央的有关指示，承担与香港特别行政区政府的工作联系等职责；设立中央人民政府驻香港特别行政区联络办公室作为中央政府驻港机构，履行联系外交部驻港特派员公署和香港驻军、促进香港与内地各领域的交流与合作、联系香港社会各界人士、处理有关涉台事务等职责。<br><br>

――负责管理与香港特别行政区有关的外交事务。第一，支持香港特别行政区积极开展对外交往与合作。支持和协助香港以适当身份参与国际组织和国际会议。协助香港申办各类重要国际会议，支持香港发展国际会展中心、区域法律服务和纠纷解决中心。支持推荐香港人士到国际组织任职，支持香港特别行政区护照在其他国家和地区获得免签待遇，支持香港特别行政区政府驻外经贸办事处开展工作。第二，妥善处理国际条约在香港特别行政区的适用等条约法律问题。办理香港新适用的多边条约及修正案超过170项。授权香港对外缔结投资保护、民航、税收、司法协助类协定338项。协助香港接受国际公约履约审议。支持香港在经济、贸易、金融、航运、通讯、旅游、文化、体育等领域以“中国香港”的名义单独同世界各国、各地区及有关国际组织保持和发展关系，签订和履行有关协议。授权和协助香港对外开展司法合作。第三，审批外国在香港特别行政区设立领事机构或其他官方、半官方机构。目前，外国在香港协议设立的总领事馆达66个、名誉领事73位。第四，全力维护香港同胞在海外的安全与合法权益，积极开展涉港领事保护工作。据不完全统计，截至2013年底，中国驻外使领馆共处理万余起涉港领保案。第五，防范和遏制外部势力干预香港事务。香港事务是中国内政，针对个别国家的干预言行，中央政府及时通过外交渠道进行交涉。外交部在香港特别行政区设立特派员公署，处理外交事务。
<br><br>
――负责管理香港特别行政区的防务。经中央决定并于1996年1月组建中国人民解放军驻香港部队。1996年12月30日，第八届全国人大常委会第二十三次会议通过《中华人民共和国香港特别行政区驻军法》。1997年7月1日零时，香港驻军进驻香港，依法履行防备和抵抗侵略、保卫香港特别行政区的安全，担负防卫勤务，管理军事设施，承办有关的涉外军事事宜等防务职责。香港驻军坚持依法驻军、依法治军，认真完成各项防务任务，组织海空巡逻、海空难搜救演习、诸军兵种联合演习、跨营区机动演练等军事行动，为维护国家主权和领土完整提供了有力保障。香港驻军还踊跃参加香港社会公益活动，开展军营开放、举办香港青少年军事夏令营等活动，加强军地互访联系，增进香港驻军与香港居民的相互了解和信任，充分展现了威武之师、文明之师的良好形象。
<br><br>
――行使宪法和香港基本法赋予全国人大常委会的职权。第一，对香港特别行政区立法机关制定的法律予以备案审查。截至2013年底，全国人大常委会收到香港特别行政区报请备案的法律共570件。第二，对香港基本法附件三所列在特别行政区实施的全国性法律作出增减决定。目前，共有12部全国性法律列入香港基本法附件三，并在香港实施。第三，对香港特别行政区作出新的授权。1996年，全国人大常委会即授权香港特别行政区政府指定其入境事务处为香港特别行政区受理国籍申请的机关，根据国籍法及其解释规定对所有国籍申请事宜作出处理。2006年，全国人大常委会授权香港对深圳湾口岸港方口岸区依照特别行政区法律实施管辖。第四，对香港基本法作出解释。全国人大常委会先后于1999年、2004年、2005年、2011年分别就香港永久性居民在香港以外所生中国籍子女等的居留权问题、行政长官产生办法和立法会产生办法修改的法律程序问题、补选产生的行政长官的任期问题和国家豁免原则等问题，对基本法及其附件的有关条款作出解释。第五，对香港特别行政区政制发展问题作出决定。全国人大常委会2004年对香港特别行政区2007年行政长官和2008年立法会产生办法有关问题作出决定；2007年对香港特别行政区2012年行政长官和立法会产生办法及有关普选问题作出决定。第六，批准和备案香港特别行政区行政长官和立法会产生办法修正案。2010年，批准香港特别行政区2012年行政长官产生办法修正案，同意将2012年立法会产生办法和表决程序修正案予以备案。第七，对香港特别行政区终审法院法官和高等法院首席法官的任命或免职进行备案，等等。此外，根据香港基本法和全国人大有关决定，1997年7月1日香港基本法实施时设立的全国人大常委会香港基本法委员会，由内地和香港人士共同组成，负责就香港特别行政区立法机关制定的法律是否符合基本法关于中央管理的事务及中央和香港特别行政区的关系的条款、对附件三所列适用于香港的全国性法律的增减以及基本法的解释或修改等问题，向全国人大常委会提供意见。
<br><br>
（二）香港特别行政区依法实行高度自治
<br><br>
香港特别行政区成立后，保持原有资本主义制度和生活方式不变，法律基本不变。特别行政区依法保护私有财产权，保持自由港和单独关税区地位、保持财政独立，实行独立的税收制度，自行制定经贸、金融和教科文卫体政策，等等。根据香港基本法和全国人大常委会关于处理香港原有法律的决定，香港原有法律，即普通法、衡平法、条例、附属立法和习惯法，除同香港基本法相抵触或经香港特别行政区立法机关作出修改者外，予以保留。在此基础上，香港特别行政区依法实行高度自治，充分行使行政管理权、立法权、独立的司法权和终审权。
<br><br>
香港特别行政区行政长官是特别行政区的首长，代表香港特别行政区，既对中央人民政府负责又对香港特别行政区负责。行政长官还是特别行政区政府的首长，依法履行基本法授予的领导特别行政区政府、负责执行基本法以及其他各项职权。行政长官在行使职权时须执行中央人民政府就香港基本法有关事项发出的指令。特别行政区政府由香港永久性居民依照基本法有关规定组成，设政务司、财政司、律政司和各局、处、署，行使基本法规定的制定和执行政策、管理各项行政事务等职权。特别行政区享有的行政管理权极为广泛，涵盖经济、教育、科学、文化、体育、宗教、社会服务、社会治安、出入境管理等领域。此外，根据中央政府的授权，特别行政区还享有一定的对外事务权。
<br><br>
香港特别行政区立法会是特别行政区的立法机关，经选举产生并根据基本法行使职权，包括根据基本法规定并依照法定程序制定、修改和废除法律；根据政府的提案，审核、通过财政预算；批准税收和公共开支等。特别行政区享有的立法权也极为广泛，可以依照基本法制定民事、刑事、商事和诉讼程序等各方面适用于特别行政区的法律。特别行政区立法会制定的法律须报全国人大常委会备案。全国人大常委会在征询香港基本法委员会后，如认为特别行政区立法机关制定的任何法律不符合基本法关于中央管理的事务及中央和特别行政区的关系的条款，可将有关法律发回，但不作修改。经全国人大常委会发回的法律立即失效。
<br><br>
香港特别行政区各级法院是特别行政区的司法机关，依法独立行使审判权。特别行政区成立后，设立终审法院行使特别行政区的终审权。原在香港实行的司法体制，除因设立终审法院而产生变化外，予以保留。原在香港实施的普通法及相关的司法原则和制度，包括独立审判原则、遵循先例原则、陪审制度原则等延续实行。特别行政区法院对国防、外交等国家行为无管辖权，除继续保持香港原有法律制度和原则对法院审判权所作的限制外，对特别行政区所有的案件均有审判权。特别行政区法院审判案件时可参考其他普通法适用地区的司法判例，终审法院可根据需要邀请其他普通法适用地区的法官参加审判。
<br><br>
三、香港特别行政区各项事业取得全面进步
<br><br>
香港特别行政区成立以来，在中央政府和祖国内地的大力支持下，特别行政区政府团结带领香港各界人士，攻坚克难，砥砺奋进，充分发挥“一国两制”的制度优势，保持香港社会经济政治大局稳定，推动各项事业向前发展，不断取得新成就、新进步。
<br><br>
――香港居民的基本权利和自由得到充分保护。香港居民依法享有的基本权利和自由，受到宪法、香港基本法以及香港本地法律的充分保障。宪法和香港基本法从宪制层面确保了香港特别行政区居民的基本权利和自由，香港特别行政区还通过实施《性别歧视条例》、《种族歧视条例》、《个人资料（私隐）条例》、《独立监察警方处理投诉委员会条例》、《最低工资条例》等法例，为香港居民的权利和自由提供进一步保障。特别行政区政府设立平等机会委员会、个人资料私隐专员公署、申诉专员公署、法律援助署、独立监察警方处理投诉委员会、法律援助服务局、妇女委员会、扶贫委员会等多个机构，协助推广、保护居民的基本权利和自由。
<br><br>
此外，香港基本法明确规定，香港特别行政区居民中的中国公民依法参与国家事务的管理。根据全国人大确定的名额和代表产生办法，由香港居民中的中国公民选出香港特别行政区的全国人大代表，参加最高国家权力机关的工作。香港特别行政区先后举行四届全国人大代表选举，每届均由具有广泛代表性的全国人大代表选举会议选举产生36名代表。中国人民政治协商会议历来重视吸收香港同胞参加，除特邀香港人士界别外，其他一些界别也吸收香港社会代表性人士。政协第十二届全国委员会特邀香港人士界别有香港地区委员124人，其他16个界别有香港地区委员82人。
<br><br>
――民主政制依法稳步推进。香港回归前，英国委派总督在香港实行了150多年的殖民统治。回归后，香港特别行政区政府和立法机关由当地人组成。行政长官在当地通过选举或协商产生，由中央人民政府任命；立法机关由选举产生。香港基本法明确规定行政长官和立法会全部议员最终由普选产生，使之成为法定目标。香港特别行政区成立以来，中央政府和香港特别行政区政府坚定不移地按照香港基本法和全国人大常委会有关决定的规定，推动以行政长官产生办法和立法会产生办法为主要内容的民主政制循序渐进向前发展。
<br><br>
行政长官选举的民主程度不断提高。第一任行政长官人选经400人组成的推选委员会选举产生，第二任至第四任行政长官人选经选举委员会选举产生，选举委员会的规模由800人增至1200人。选举委员会由“工商、金融界”，“专业界”，“劳工、社会服务、宗教等界”以及“立法会议员、区议会议员的代表、乡议局的代表、香港特别行政区全国人大代表、香港特别行政区全国政协委员的代表”四大界别人士按相同比例组成，体现了均衡参与，具有广泛代表性。
<br><br>
立法会选举的直选因素不断增加。1998年选举产生的第一届立法会包括20名分区直接选举的议员，30名功能团体选举的议员和10名选举委员会选举的议员。2000年选举产生的第二届立法会包括24名分区直接选举的议员，30名功能团体选举的议员和6名选举委员会选举的议员。2004年选举产生的第三届立法会和2008年选举产生的第四届立法会，分区直接选举的议员和功能团体选举的议员各为30名。2012年第五届立法会选举时，立法会议员人数增加至70人，分区直接选举的议员和功能团体选举的议员各为35名，其中新增加的5个功能团体选举议席由区议会议员提名、并经全港原来没有功能团体选举权的选民一人一票选举产生。
<br><br>
设定普选时间表。2007年12月29日，第十届全国人大常委会第三十一次会议决定，2017年香港特别行政区第五任行政长官的选举可以实行由普选产生的办法；在行政长官由普选产生以后，香港特别行政区立法会的选举可以实行全部议员由普选产生的办法，为行政长官和立法会全部议员普选设定了时间表。2013年12月4日至2014年5月3日，香港特别行政区政府就2017年行政长官和2016年立法会产生办法进行为期5个月的公众咨询，启动了实现普选的有关程序。
<br><br>
――经济保持平稳发展。整体经济保持增长。1997年至2013年，香港本地生产总值年均实质增长3.4%，人均本地生产总值按美元累计增长39.3%。根据国际货币基金组织2013年数据，按购买力平价（PPP）计算，香港本地生产总值位居全球第35位，人均本地生产总值位居全球第7位。
<br><br>
国际金融、贸易、航运中心地位得以保持和提升。香港是重要的国际银行中心、全球第六大证券市场和第五大外汇市场。在多项国际金融中心的世界排名中，香港位居前列。香港是全球第九大贸易经济体，与世界上几乎所有的国家和地区保持贸易联系。香港是全球最大的集装箱港口之一和第四大船舶注册中心。香港国际机场是世界最繁忙的航空港之一，客运量位居全球第五位，货运量多年高居全球首位。
<br><br>
传统优势产业不断巩固和发展。贸易及物流、旅游、金融、专业服务及其他工商业支援服务四大支柱产业继续发挥重要作用。2012年，四大产业增加值共占香港本地生产总值的58%，吸纳就业人数占总就业人数的47.2%。香港还着力培育和发展文化及创意、创新及科技、检测认证、环保等产业。
<br><br>
营商环境保持良好。香港是全球公认的最自由经济体之一。在世界银行对全球185个经济体营商环境的排名中，香港多年位居前列。根据联合国贸易和发展会议《2013年世界投资报告》，香港在吸收外来直接投资方面位居全球第三位。在瑞士洛桑国际管理发展学院《世界竞争力年报》排名中，香港多年来都被评为全球最具竞争力经济体之一。
<br><br>
――各项社会事业迈上新台阶。教育事业在亚太地区保持领先地位。香港特别行政区政府持续加大对教育投入，2014－2015财政年度教育总支出预算为753.7亿港元，是政府开支的第一大项目。2008－2009学年开始在公营学校实施十二年免费教育。根据英国泰晤士高等教育研究机构公布的2013年亚洲大学排行榜，香港大学、香港科技大学进入前十名；2013－2014年世界大学排名中，香港大学名列第43位。在反映基础教育水平的“国际学生评估（PISA）” 2012年全球测试中，香港继续名列前茅。
<br><br>
医疗卫生事业不断进步。2014－2015财政年度用于医疗服务的财政预算支出524亿港元，占政府经常开支的17%。香港居民可平等享受价格低廉的公立医院服务。截至2012年底，香港各类医疗卫生机构共有病床3.55万张。香港婴儿死亡率由1997年的4‰下降至2013年的1.6‰，是全球婴儿死亡率最低的地方之一。2013年香港男性与女性的预期寿命分别为80.9岁及86.6岁，是全球预期寿命最高的地方之一。
<br><br>
文化、体育事业蓬勃发展。香港中外文化荟萃，特别行政区政府鼓励文化艺术多元发展，促进相互交流。香港已有潮人盂兰胜会、大坑舞火龙、大澳端午龙舟游涌、长洲太平清醮等4个独有项目被列入第三批国家级非物质文化遗产名录。香港2008年协办北京奥运会马术比赛项目，2009年主办第五届东亚运动会。帆板、乒乓球、自行车、武术等项目的运动员在奥运会、世锦赛、亚锦赛等国际赛场上屡创佳绩。
<br><br>
社会保障逐步完善。香港特别行政区政府在社会福利方面的开支总额由1997－1998财政年度的204亿港元增长到2014－2015财政年度预算的619亿港元，增长了2.03倍。香港已形成多层次、多元化的社会保障和福利服务体系。社会服务机构共有400多家，注册社工从1998年底的8300名发展到目前的1.8万多名。特别行政区政府还积极推动公共房屋建设，协助基层市民入住公共房屋，资助市民自置居所。香港约有一半市民居住在政府提供或资助的房屋，其中超过200万人租住公共房屋，100多万人居住在政府资助的自置房屋。
<br><br>
――对外交往和国际影响进一步扩大。对外联系更加广泛。截至2013年6月，香港以中国政府代表团成员或其他适当身份参与以国家为单位参加的共41个政府间国际组织相关活动，参加不限主权国家参加的政府间国际组织37个。香港以中国政府代表团成员身份或其他适当身份参加有关国际会议1400多次，以“中国香港”名义参加不以国家为单位参加的国际会议2万余次,共举办或协办国际会议1000多次。香港特别行政区已与42个国家签署互免签证协议，150个国家和地区单方面给予特别行政区护照持有人免签或落地签待遇。香港特别行政区还与多个国家签署了民用航空运输、避免双重征税、促进和保护投资、刑事司法协助等协定。香港特别行政区政府在日内瓦、伦敦、东京、纽约、柏林等11个地方设立了驻外经济贸易办事处。欧盟委员会等6个国际组织在香港设立了代表机构。
<br><br>
杰出专业人士担任国际组织重要职位。在中央政府的大力支持下，香港特别行政区政府卫生署原署长陈冯富珍女士2006年11月当选为世界卫生组织总干事，并于2012年5月成功连任，是联合国成立以来第一位担任政府间国际组织最高负责人的中国人；香港天文台台长岑智明先生2010年2月当选为世界气象组织航空气象学委员会主席。
<br><br>
四、中央政府全力支持香港特别行政区繁荣发展
<br><br>
中央政府始终高度重视香港的经济发展和民生改善，全力支持香港应对各种困难和挑战，在谋划和推进国家整体发展战略时充分发挥香港的作用，积极推动香港与内地开展交流合作，为香港保持繁荣稳定提供坚强后盾。
<br><br>
（一）支持香港特别行政区应对风险和挑战
<br><br>
――支持香港应对亚洲金融危机。1997年亚洲金融危机爆发并迅速蔓延，港元受到国际投机势力狙击，香港金融市场动荡，与美元挂钩的联系汇率制度遭受冲击，金融体系的稳定受到严重威胁。中央政府郑重宣布，将不惜一切代价维护香港特别行政区的繁荣稳定，坚决支持香港特别行政区政府维护联系汇率制度，坚持人民币不贬值。在中央政府的支持下，香港特别行政区政府采取果断措施，维护了金融和社会的稳定。<br><br>

――支持香港抗击非典。2003年上半年，非典疫情肆虐香港，不仅危及香港同胞的生命健康，而且使尚未完全摆脱亚洲金融危机影响的香港经济雪上加霜，通货紧缩，市场萧条，失业率上升至8.7%。为保障香港同胞生命安全，帮助香港经济走出低迷，中央政府及时伸出援助之手。在内地同样急需抗疫医药物资的情况下，中央政府无偿向香港提供大批抗疫药品和器材。国家领导人亲赴香港疫情重灾区和医院视察慰问。当年6月29日，内地与香港签署《内地与香港关于建立更紧密经贸关系的安排》（CEPA），确定了两地在货物贸易、服务贸易和贸易投资便利化三个领域的开放措施和实施目标。随后又实施内地居民赴香港“个人游”政策。这些都为香港摆脱非典冲击、恢复经济增长注入“强心剂”。
<br><br>
――支持香港应对国际金融危机。2008年下半年国际金融危机爆发后，中央政府高度关注香港受到的影响，当年12月即推出支持香港经济金融稳定发展的14项政策措施。2009年1月，中央政府再次推出包括中国人民银行与香港金融管理局签署2000亿元人民币货币互换协议在内的一系列政策举措。此后，国家领导人在访问香港期间又先后宣布多项支持香港发展经济、改善民生，加强与内地交流合作的政策措施。这对提振港人信心、增强抵御风险能力、刺激香港经济复苏发挥了积极作用。
<br><br>
（二）支持香港特别行政区巩固和提升竞争优势
<br><br>
――支持香港国际金融、贸易、航运中心发展。支持香港开展个人人民币业务、发行人民币债券、开展跨境贸易人民币结算试点等，奠定了香港人民币离岸市场的先发优势。继续鼓励内地企业在香港上市融资，并推出其他支持香港金融业发展的措施。2013年，香港人民币清算平台参加行共有216家；经香港处理的跨境贸易人民币结算金额为3.84万亿人民币，占全部跨境贸易人民币结算总额的82.9%；香港人民币客户存款及存款证余额突破1万亿元人民币。香港已成为全球最大的离岸人民币业务中心。继2003年签署CEPA并于2004年1月实施后，内地与香港陆续签署和实施了10个补充协议。内地对原产于香港的产品全部实行零关税。截至2013年底，在货物贸易方面，CEPA项下内地自香港进口商品额为71.61亿美元，关税优惠39.83亿元人民币；在服务贸易方面，共采取403项开放措施。按照世界贸易组织贸易分类标准，通过CEPA及其补充协议，内地对香港服务贸易开放的部门达到149个，涉及目前服务贸易部门总数的93.1%，这是目前内地商签的开放程度最高的自由贸易协议。此外，广东服务业对香港开放的先行先试措施达82项。中央政府在编制《全国沿海港口布局规划》和《“十二五”综合交通运输体系规划》等规划时，均考虑了巩固和发展香港国际航运中心的需要。
<br><br>
――支持香港旅游、零售业及内地港资企业发展。中央政府应香港特别行政区政府请求，逐步扩大“个人游”试点城市，目前已达49个城市，超过3亿人口。截至2013年底，内地共有1.29亿人次的游客通过“个人游”方式到香港旅游。据香港特别行政区政府测算，2012年“个人游”为香港带来相当于本地生产总值1.3%的增加值，创造了超过11万个职位，占本地整体就业的3.1%。为更多地惠及香港中小商户和基层市民，中央政府还允许香港居民在内地开办个体工商户。截至2013年底，内地共注册香港个体工商户5982户，从业人员16476人。中央政府高度重视在内地的香港加工贸易企业的发展，积极支持和帮助内地港资企业转型升级。2009年，广东省出台了30条支持港澳台资企业应对国际金融危机和加快转型升级的政策措施。2011年12月，中央政府出台《关于促进加工贸易转型升级的指导意见》，在苏州、东莞等地开展加工贸易转型升级示范区和试点城市建设，并在中西部地区培育建设44个梯度转移重点承接地。
<br><br>
（三）支持香港特别行政区与内地加强各领域的交流合作
<br><br>
香港回归以来，中央政府把保持香港繁荣稳定作为国家整体发展战略的重要内容。“十五”、“十一五”规划纲要明确提出要保持香港的长期繁荣稳定，巩固和加强香港国际金融、贸易、航运中心地位。“十二五”规划纲要首次将涉港澳内容单独成章，并进一步明确香港在国家发展中的战略地位，强调国家支持香港巩固提升竞争力、支持香港培育新兴产业、深化内地与香港经济合作。
<br><br>
――支持香港特别行政区与内地深化经贸合作。CEPA及其补充协议的实施，有力消除香港与内地在贸易、投资等方面的制度性障碍，深化了两地经贸关系，拓宽了两地合作领域，实现了两地互利共赢。目前，内地是香港最大的贸易伙伴。2013年，据香港统计，香港与内地的贸易额38913亿港元，比1997年增长2.49倍，占香港对外贸易总额的51.1%。同时，香港是内地最重要的贸易伙伴和主要出口市场之一。香港还是内地最大的境外融资中心。截至2013年底，在香港上市的内地企业797家，占香港上市公司总数的48.5%；在香港上市的内地企业总市值13.7万亿港元，占香港股市总市值的56.9%。此外，内地与香港还互为外来直接投资的最大来源地。截至2013年底，内地对香港直接投资超过3588亿美元，占内地对外直接投资总额的近六成；内地累计批准港商投资项目近36万个，实际使用港资累计6656.7亿美元，占内地累计吸收境外投资的47.7%。
<br><br>
――支持香港特别行政区与内地各省、自治区、直辖市特别是广东省加强区域合作。中央政府批准设立粤港合作联席会议、泛珠三角区域合作与发展论坛。批准实施《珠江三角洲地区改革发展规划纲要（2008－2020年）》、《横琴总体发展规划》、《前海深港现代服务业合作区总体发展规划》、《广州南沙新区发展规划》，批准广东省与香港特别行政区签署《粤港合作框架协议》，明确粤港合作的重点领域，构建珠海横琴新区、深圳前海深港现代服务业合作区、广州南沙新区三大合作平台，促进粤港两地共同打造更具综合竞争力的世界级城市群和世界先进制造业、先进服务业基地。还批准香港特别行政区与北京市、上海市建立区域合作机制，支持香港特别行政区政府在内地设立办事机构。香港特别行政区政府除在北京设立办事处外，还先后在广州、上海、成都、武汉设立经济贸易办事处，在深圳、重庆、福州设立联络处，促进了香港与内地有关地方的经贸合作以及其他方面的交流。
<br><br>
――支持香港特别行政区与内地跨境基础设施建设和人员、货物通关便利化。深圳湾公路大桥于2007年建成通车，成为内地与香港间第4条陆路通道。2009年开工、预计2016年建成的港珠澳大桥，东接香港、西接珠海和澳门，将成为连接珠江东西两岸新的公路运输通道。广深港高速铁路全线建成通车后，香港将与全国高速铁路网对接。内地与香港的所有水、陆货运口岸均已实现查验结果完全互认。2013年内地访港旅客4075万人次，比1997年增长16.3倍。香港同胞进入内地人数也从1997年的3977万人次增至2013年的7688万人次。
<br><br>
――支持香港特别行政区与内地加强教育、科技、文化等领域交流合作。支持香港与内地高校开展跨地招收学生；支持香港与内地高校合作办学；支持两地教师、学生开展交流。支持香港高等院校、科研机构和香港科技园等建立国家重点实验室伙伴实验室、国家工程技术研究中心香港分中心和国家高新技术产业化基地；支持香港高校在深圳设立研究院；支持香港科技工作者和机构申请国家科技研发项目、推动国家重大科技项目向香港开放。2005年，内地与香港签署《内地与香港特别行政区更紧密文化关系安排协议书》，在文化保育、产业发展和交流等方面展开全面合作。支持香港、澳门与广东共同申报并成功将粤剧列入联合国教科文组织《人类非物质文化遗产代表作名录》；支持香港西贡地质公园成功申报为世界地质公园；支持香港与内地合拍电影，自CEPA签署以来香港与内地合拍影片共322部，占内地与境外合拍影片总量的70%。支持两地在体育人才交流、培养、训练等方面展开合作，邀请香港运动员参加全国运动会等赛事。支持香港与内地在中医中药发展、医疗卫生管理、传染病疫情通报和防治，以及突发公共卫生事件通报和紧急合作等方面开展交流合作。
<br><br>
――支持香港特别行政区政府与中央政府有关部门建立交流合作机制。香港特别行政区政府与中央政府有关部门建立了不同领域、不同层级的交流合作机制，协调、推进相关工作。比如，设立CEPA联合指导委员会，监督CEPA的执行并解决执行过程中的问题，拟定CEPA内容的补充及修订等；在出入境管理、海关、检验检疫、金融、公共卫生、旅游等领域建立合作机制，相互沟通情况，共同处置突发事件，打击违法行为等。此外，为加强对深圳前海深港现代服务业合作区、广州南沙新区、珠海横琴新区开发建设的指导、协调和服务，中央政府还建立了促进广东前海南沙横琴建设部际联席会议制度，香港特别行政区政府是成员单位之一。这些机制为促进香港与内地的互利合作、处理共同关注的区域发展和治理问题发挥了积极作用。
<br><br>
（四）确保对香港基本生活物资的安全稳定供应
<br><br>
受自然环境限制，香港所需的淡水、蔬菜、肉禽等基本生活物资主要由内地供应。自20世纪60年代初内地开通供应香港鲜活冷冻商品的“三趟快车”并建设东深供水工程以来，中央政府和有关地方全力保障对香港食品、农副产品、水、电、天然气等的供应。截至2013年底，香港市场活猪95%、活牛100%、活鸡33%、河鲜产品100%、蔬菜90%、面粉70%以上由内地供应，供港食品合格率一直保持在较高水平。2013年，广东按照与香港新修订的协议对香港供应淡水6.06亿立方米。自1994年起，大亚湾核电站向香港供电，每年供电量占全港电力总消耗的四分之一。2013年，内地向香港供应天然气25.31亿立方米。

五、全面准确理解和贯彻“一国两制”方针政策
<br><br>
“一国两制”是一项开创性事业，对中央来说是治国理政的重大课题，对香港和香港同胞来说是重大历史转折。在香港特别行政区各项事业取得全面进步的同时，“一国两制”在香港的实践也遇到了新情况新问题，香港社会还有一些人没有完全适应这一重大历史转折，特别是对“一国两制”方针政策和基本法有模糊认识和片面理解。目前香港出现的一些在经济社会和政制发展问题上的不正确观点都与此有关。因此，要把“一国两制”在香港特别行政区的实践继续推向前进，必须从维护国家主权、安全、发展利益，保持香港长期繁荣稳定的根本宗旨出发，全面准确理解和贯彻“一国两制”方针政策，把坚持一国原则和尊重两制差异、维护中央权力和保障特别行政区高度自治权、发挥祖国内地坚强后盾作用和提高香港自身竞争力有机结合起来，任何时候都不能偏废。
<br><br>
（一）全面准确把握“一国两制”的含义
<br><br>
“一国两制”是一个完整的概念。“一国”是指在中华人民共和国内，香港特别行政区是国家不可分离的部分，是直辖于中央人民政府的地方行政区域。中华人民共和国是单一制国家，中央政府对包括香港特别行政区在内的所有地方行政区域拥有全面管治权。香港特别行政区的高度自治权不是固有的，其唯一来源是中央授权。香港特别行政区享有的高度自治权不是完全自治，也不是分权，而是中央授予的地方事务管理权。高度自治权的限度在于中央授予多少权力，香港特别行政区就享有多少权力，不存在“剩余权力”。同时，宪法明确规定国家的根本制度是社会主义制度，并规定了国家的基本制度、领导核心和指导思想等制度和原则。坚持一国原则，最根本的是要维护国家主权、安全和发展利益，尊重国家实行的根本制度以及其他制度和原则。
<br><br>
“两制”是指在“一国”之内，国家主体实行社会主义制度，香港等某些区域实行资本主义制度。“一国”是实行“两制”的前提和基础，“两制”从属和派生于“一国”，并统一于“一国”之内。“一国”之内的“两制”并非等量齐观，国家的主体必须实行社会主义制度，是不会改变的。在这个前提下，从实际出发，充分照顾到香港等某些区域的历史和现实情况，允许其保持资本主义制度长期不变。因此，国家主体坚持社会主义制度，是香港实行资本主义制度，保持繁荣稳定的前提和保障。香港继续保持原有的资本主义制度，依照基本法实行“港人治港”、高度自治，必须在坚持一国原则的前提下，充分尊重国家主体实行的社会主义制度，特别是尊重国家实行的政治体制以及其他制度和原则。内地在坚持社会主义制度的同时，要尊重和包容香港实行的资本主义制度，还可以借鉴香港在经济发展和社会管理等方面的成功经验。在“一国”之内，“两种制度”只有相互尊重，相互借鉴，才能和谐并存，共同发展。
<br><br>
（二）坚决维护宪法和香港基本法的权威
<br><br>
宪法和香港基本法共同构成香港特别行政区的宪制基础。宪法作为国家的根本法，在包括香港特别行政区在内的中华人民共和国领土范围内具有最高法律地位和最高法律效力。香港基本法是根据宪法制定的、规定香港特别行政区制度的基本法律，在香港特别行政区具有宪制性法律地位。香港特别行政区的制度和政策均以香港基本法的规定为依据；香港特别行政区立法机关制定的任何法律，均不得同香港基本法相抵触。香港特别行政区行政、立法、司法行为都必须符合香港基本法；在香港特别行政区的个人以及一切组织和团体都必须以香港基本法为活动准则。同时，香港基本法作为全国性法律，在全国范围内适用。
<br><br>
全面把握、整体理解香港基本法的各项规定。香港基本法的所有规定都是香港特别行政区制度的有机组成部分，条文之间不是孤立的，而是相互联系的，必须把香港基本法的每个条文放在整体规定中来理解，放在香港特别行政区制度体系中来把握。香港基本法实施的实践说明，孤立地理解香港基本法的个别条文，强调一个方面而忽略另一个方面，就会产生歧义甚至认识上的偏差，香港基本法的实施就会受到严重冲击；全面地理解香港基本法的各项规定，就会看到特别行政区制度的各个组成部分共同构成有机整体，对香港居民的基本权利和自由、对香港的繁荣稳定发挥着保障作用。
<br><br>
尊重和维护全国人大及其常委会对香港基本法的修改权和解释权。香港基本法规定，香港基本法的解释权属于全国人民代表大会常务委员会，修改权属于全国人民代表大会。香港基本法同时规定，香港特别行政区法院在审理案件时可对基本法中香港特别行政区自治范围内的条款自行解释，也可对其他条款解释。这种解释权来源于全国人大常委会的授权。如果香港特别行政区法院在审理案件时需要对香港基本法关于中央政府管理的事务或中央和香港特别行政区关系的条款进行解释，而该条款的解释又影响到案件的判决，在对该案件作出不可上诉的终局判决前，应由香港特别行政区终审法院提请全国人大常委会作出解释。如全国人大常委会作出解释，香港特别行政区法院在引用该条款时，须以全国人大常委会的解释为准。这与香港特别行政区的法律地位是一致的。全国人大常委会依法行使基本法解释权是维护“一国两制”和香港法治的应有之义，既是对特别行政区执行基本法的监督，也是对特别行政区实行高度自治的保障。
<br><br>
完善与香港基本法实施相关的制度和机制，有利于更好地维护香港基本法的权威。香港基本法实施以来，已经建立完善了一系列与之相关的制度和机制，包括在行政长官产生办法和立法会产生办法的修改方面，确立了行政长官向全国人大常委会提出报告、全国人大常委会作出决定、立法会通过、行政长官同意及全国人大常委会批准或备案的“五步曲”法律程序；在基本法解释方面，建立了全国人大常委会主动释法、行政长官向国务院作出报告并由国务院提请全国人大常委会释法以及特别行政区终审法院提请全国人大常委会释法等有关程序和工作机制；在特别行政区立法方面，明确了全国人大常委会处理特别行政区法律备案的工作程序；在特别行政区与内地司法协助方面，达成了相互送达民商事司法文书、相互认可和执行仲裁裁决和部分民商事判决等一系列安排；在行政长官向中央政府负责方面，形成了行政长官向中央述职的制度安排。随着“一国两制”实践不断发展，香港基本法实施不断深入，必然要求继续完善与香港基本法实施相关的制度和机制，特别是要着眼香港的长治久安，把香港基本法规定的属于中央的权力行使好，使中央与香港特别行政区的关系切实纳入法制化、规范化轨道运行。
<br><br>
（三）坚持以爱国者为主体的“港人治港”
<br><br>
“港人治港”是有界限和标准的，这就是邓小平所强调的必须由以爱国者为主体的港人来治理香港。对国家效忠是从政者必须遵循的基本政治伦理。在“一国两制”之下，包括行政长官、主要官员、行政会议成员、立法会议员、各级法院法官和其他司法人员等在内的治港者，肩负正确理解和贯彻执行香港基本法的重任，承担维护国家主权、安全、发展利益，保持香港长期繁荣稳定的职责。爱国是对治港者主体的基本政治要求。如果治港者不是以爱国者为主体，或者说治港者主体不能效忠于国家和香港特别行政区，“一国两制”在香港特别行政区的实践就会偏离正确方向，不仅国家主权、安全、发展利益难以得到切实维护，而且香港的繁荣稳定和广大港人的福祉也将受到威胁和损害。
<br><br>
爱国者治港也是具有法律依据的。宪法和香港基本法规定设立香港特别行政区，就是为了维护国家的统一和领土完整，保持香港长期繁荣稳定。因此，香港基本法规定特别行政区行政长官、主要官员、行政会议成员、立法会主席及立法会百分之八十以上的议员、终审法院和高等法院的首席法官，都必须由在外国无居留权的香港永久性居民中的中国公民担任；行政长官、主要官员、行政会议成员、立法会议员、各级法院法官和其他司法人员在就职时必须依法宣誓拥护中华人民共和国香港特别行政区基本法，效忠中华人民共和国香港特别行政区；行政长官必须就执行基本法向中央和特别行政区负责。这是体现国家主权的需要，确保治港者主体效忠国家，并使其接受中央政府和香港社会的监督，切实对国家、对香港特别行政区以及香港居民负起责任。
<br><br>
（四）坚定支持行政长官和特别行政区政府依法施政
<br><br>
作为特别行政区和特别行政区政府的“双首长”，行政长官是香港贯彻落实“一国两制”方针政策和基本法的第一责任人。中央政府始终坚定不移地支持行政长官和特别行政区政府依法施政，团结带领香港社会各界人士集中精力发展经济，切实有效改善民生，循序渐进推进民主，包容共济促进和谐。
<br><br>
发展经济、改善民生，是广大香港市民的共同愿望，是香港特别行政区解决社会矛盾、维护大局稳定的重要基础，是行政长官和特别行政区政府依法施政的主要任务。当前，香港正处于发展的关键时期，挑战和机遇并存。香港需要抓住机遇，努力解决经济社会发展中存在的突出问题，进一步巩固和提升自身的竞争优势，保持经济社会平稳发展，增进香港居民民生福祉。祖国内地始终是香港的坚强后盾。
<br><br>
中央政府继续支持香港特别行政区依照基本法的规定循序渐进发展符合香港实际情况的民主政制。行政长官最终达至由一个有广泛代表性的提名委员会按民主程序提名后普选产生，立法会最终达至全部议员由普选产生，这是中央政府作出的庄重承诺，并体现在香港基本法的规定和全国人大常委会的有关决定中。中央政府真诚地支持香港的民主政制向前发展。行政长官和立法会普选制度必须符合国家主权、安全和发展利益，符合香港实际，兼顾社会各阶层利益，体现均衡参与的原则，有利于资本主义发展，特别是要符合香港特别行政区作为直辖于中央人民政府的地方行政区域的法律地位，符合香港基本法和全国人大常委会有关决定的规定，经普选产生的行政长官人选必须是爱国爱港人士。只要香港社会各界按照上述原则务实讨论，凝聚共识，就一定能够实现行政长官和立法会全部议员最终由普选产生的目标。
<br><br>
香港是一个自由开放多元的社会，也是中外交融的国际商业都市。维护社会和谐稳定，不仅符合香港社会各阶层、各界别、各方面以及外来投资者的共同利益，也是保持香港作为国际金融、贸易、航运中心地位的重要条件。中央政府将继续鼓励和支持香港社会各界发扬包容共济、尊重法治、维护秩序的优良传统，以国家的根本利益和香港的整体利益、长远利益为依归，求同存异、互谅互助，在爱国爱港旗帜下实现最广泛的团结，不断巩固社会和谐稳定。
<br><br>
（五）继续推动内地与香港交流合作
<br><br>
香港与内地日益紧密的交流合作，拓宽了香港与内地优势互补、共同发展的道路。香港可以充分利用内地广阔的市场腹地和丰富的要素资源，把握国家快速发展的机遇，从中获得巨大的发展空间和不竭的发展动力。香港通过继续巩固、提升既有优势，可以进一步发挥作为国家引进外资、人才，吸收借鉴国际先进技术和管理经验的窗口作用，国家实施“走出去”战略的桥梁作用，对内地加快转变经济发展方式的助推作用，以及对内地创新经济社会管理方式的借鉴作用。
<br><br>
随着香港与内地交往的密切，两地民众之间的相互了解逐渐加深，香港同胞对国家的认同和向心力不断增强。香港同胞更加关心国家发展，在积极参与国家现代化建设的同时，热心投入内地扶贫、教育、妇女儿童保护等公益事业。当内地遭受重大自然灾害时，香港同胞慷慨相助，大力支援抢险救灾和灾后重建工作，与内地民众共克时艰。这充分显示出香港同胞与内地民众血浓于水的亲情。
<br><br>
中央政府将继续支持香港特别行政区政府与中央政府有关部门、内地有关地方建立更加密切的工作联系，支持香港同胞与内地民众开展更加紧密的交往，支持香港在国家全面深化改革和对外开放中发挥独特作用，推动香港与内地开展更加广泛、深入的交流合作，齐心协力建设中华民族共同家园。
<br><br>
结束语
<br><br>
“一国两制”在香港特别行政区的实践，取得了举世公认的成功。实践充分证明，“一国两制”不仅是解决历史遗留的香港问题的最佳方案，也是香港回归后保持长期繁荣稳定的最佳制度安排。坚定不移地推进“一国两制”事业，是包括香港同胞在内的全体中华儿女的共同愿望，符合国家和民族根本利益，符合香港的整体和长远利益，也符合外来投资者的利益。
<br><br>
在继续推进“一国两制”事业的新征程上,既要坚持全面准确地理解和贯彻“一国两制”方针政策，确保“一国两制”实践沿着正确的轨道前进，又要积极有效应对香港在发展中面临的困难和挑战。面对内外经济环境的深刻调整和变化，香港需要不断提升竞争力；香港长期积累的一些深层次矛盾日益突出，需要社会各界群策群力共同化解；香港与内地交流合作不断深入，需要加强彼此间的沟通协调，妥善处理民众关切。同时，还要始终警惕外部势力利用香港干预中国内政的图谋，防范和遏制极少数人勾结外部势力干扰破坏“一国两制”在香港的实施。研究解决好这些问题，深化“一国两制”在香港特别行政区的实践，必将进一步彰显“一国两制”的强大生命力。
<br><br>
当前，全国人民正满怀信心地为实现“两个一百年”的奋斗目标和中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而努力奋斗。不断丰富和发展“一国两制”在香港特别行政区的实践，保持香港长期繁荣稳定，是中国梦的重要组成部分，也是完善和发展中国特色社会主义制度，推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化的必然要求。中央政府将一如既往地与香港特别行政区政府和广大香港同胞一道，全面准确贯彻“一国两制”方针政策和香港基本法，进一步推动香港特别行政区各项事业的发展。我们坚信，香港特别行政区必将继续沿着“一国两制”方针和香港基本法的轨道稳步前进，与祖国内地共同开创中华民族更加美好的明天。

Appendix<br><br>

Foreword<br><br>

"One country, two systems" is a basic state policy the Chinese government has adopted to realize the peaceful reunification of the country. Following this principle, the Chinese government successfully solved the question of Hong Kong through diplomatic negotiations with the British government, and resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, fulfilling the common aspiration of the Chinese people for the recovery of Hong Kong. As a result, Hong Kong got rid of colonial rule and returned to the embrace of the motherland, and embarked on the broad road of common development with the mainland, as they complemented each other's advantages.<br><br>

Hong Kong's return to the motherland turned "one country, two systems" from a scientific concept into vivid reality. The central government strictly adheres to the Basic Law of Hong Kong, earnestly performs its constitutional duties and stands firm in supporting the administration of the chief executive and the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in accordance with the law. The HKSAR exercises a high degree of autonomy in accordance with the law, and is vested with executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication. The previous capitalist system and way of life remain unchanged, and most laws continue to apply. Hong Kong continues to prosper, its society remains stable, and full development is being witnessed in all undertakings. The "one country, two systems" policy enjoys growing popularity in Hong Kong, winning the wholehearted support from Hong Kong compatriots as well as people in all other parts of China. It is also thought highly by the international community.<br><br>

"One country, two systems" is a new domain in which we constantly explore new possibilities and make new progress in pioneering spirit. A summary of the policy's implementation in the HKSAR, and a comprehensive and correct understanding and implementation of the policy will prove useful for safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests, for maintaining long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong, and for further promoting the "one country, two systems" practice along the correct track of development.<br><br>


I. Hong Kong's Smooth Return to China<br><br>

In the early 1980s, China's state leader Deng Xiaoping put forward the scientific concept known as "one country, two systems" in an effort to realize the peaceful reunification of China, and this ingenious design was first applied to solve the question of Hong Kong. According to Deng Xiaoping, "one country, two systems" means there is only but one China and under this premise the mainland adheres to the socialist system while Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan may retain their capitalist systems over a long time to come.<br><br>

On December 4, 1982, the Fifth Session of the Fifth National People's Congress (NPC) endorsed a new Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Its Article 31 provides, "The state may establish special administrative regions when necessary. The systems to be instituted in special administrative regions shall be prescribed by law enacted by the National People's Congress in the light of the specific conditions." Giving expression to the "one country, two systems" concept, this Article provides the constitutional basis for the establishment of special administrative regions in certain areas that adopt different social systems and different policies from those on the mainland, as the Chinese government makes efforts to realize the peaceful reunification of China. After in-depth investigations and research, the Chinese government formulated 12 basic policies regarding the question of Hong Kong, known as the "12 Principles," in early 1983. The main contents were: (1) The Chinese government decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as of July 1, 1997. (2) After resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, the central government would establish a special administrative region in Hong Kong in accordance with the provisions in Article 31 of the Constitution. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region would be directly under the authority of the Central People's Government and would enjoy a high degree of autonomy. (3) The HKSAR would be vested with legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication. The laws, decrees and regulations currently in force in Hong Kong would remain basically unchanged. (4) The government of the HKSAR would be composed of local inhabitants. The principal officials would be selected by election or through consultations held locally and be appointed by the Central People's Government. Those previously working in the public and police services in the government departments of Hong Kong may remain in employment. British and other foreign nationals may also be employed to serve as advisers to government departments of the HKSAR. (5) The current social and economic systems in Hong Kong would remain unchanged, and so would the life-style. Freedoms, including those of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of travel, of movement, of correspondence, and of religious belief would be ensured in the HKSAR. Private property, ownership of enterprises, legitimate right of inheritance and foreign investment would be protected by law. (6) The HKSAR would retain the status of a free port and a separate customs territory. (7) The HKSAR would retain the status of a financial center, and its markets for foreign exchange, gold, securities and futures would continue. There would continue to be a free flow of capital, and the Hong Kong dollar would continue to circulate and remain freely convertible. (8) The HKSAR would have independent finances. (9) The HKSAR may establish mutually beneficial economic relations with the United Kingdom, whose economic interests in Hong Kong would be given due regard. (10) Using the name "Hong Kong, China," the HKSAR may on its own maintain and develop economic and cultural relations and conclude relevant agreements with states, regions and relevant international organizations. The government of the HKSAR may itself issue travel documents for entry into and exit from Hong Kong. (11) The maintenance of public order in the HKSAR would be the responsibility of the government of the HKSAR. And (12) the above-stated policies would be stipulated in the Basic Law of the HKSAR by the NPC of the People's Republic of China (PRC), and they would remain unchanged for 50 years.

During his meeting with the visiting British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on September 24, 1982, Deng Xiaoping made clear the Chinese government's position on the question of Hong Kong, pointing out that sovereignty was not a matter for discussion and that China would take back Hong Kong in 1997. It was under this premise that China and Britain would negotiate to ensure the smooth transfer of Hong Kong and clarify what was to be done about Hong Kong 15 years later. This marked the beginning of the negotiations between China and Britain on the question of Hong Kong. On December 19, 1984, after 22 rounds of negotiations, the governments of China and Britain signed the Joint Declaration of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the Question of Hong Kong in Beijing, confirming that the government of the PRC would resume its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong with effect from July 1, 1997. The Chinese government also made clear in the Joint Declaration its basic policies regarding Hong Kong based on the "12 Principles." The signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration marked the entry of Hong Kong into a 13-year transition period before its return to China. During this period, the Chinese government unswervingly followed the "one country, two systems" policy, closely relied on the Hong Kong compatriots, and resolutely held off interference to promote the preparation work for Hong Kong's return.<br><br>

On April 10, 1985, the Third Session of the Sixth NPC decided to form the Drafting Committee for the Basic Law of the HKSAR of the PRC. In July, the Drafting Committee began its work. It completed its mission in February 1990, taking four years and eight months to develop the Basic Law of Hong Kong. The drafting of the Basic Law of Hong Kong was highly democratic and open, and the compatriots of Hong Kong were widely involved. Twenty-three of the 59 members of the Drafting Committee came from various walks of life in Hong Kong, and the Drafting Committee entrusted its Hong Kong members to set up a 180-member counseling committee in Hong Kong to collect the views and opinions of the people of Hong Kong. In April 1988, the Drafting Committee published the Basic Law of Hong Kong (draft) for comments, and in February 1989 the Standing Committee of the NPC made public the Basic Law of the HKSAR (draft) and twice widely solicited views in Hong Kong and on the mainland. People from all walks of life in Hong Kong and the mainland took active part in the deliberation and discussion of the draft, and in Hong Kong alone nearly 80,000 files of views and comments were collected. The Basic Law of Hong Kong embodies the common will of all Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots, and encapsulates the wisdom of the Chinese nation.<br><br>

On April 4, 1990, the Third Session of the Seventh NPC passed the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, and made the decision to establish the HKSAR. The Basic Law of the HKSAR is a basic law formulated in accordance with the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. It stipulates the system and policies to be instituted in the HKSAR, and is the legalization and institutionalization of the "one country, two systems" policy. It also provides a legal basis for the implementation of "one country, two systems" in the HKSAR. The Basic Law was lauded by Deng Xiaoping as a "law of historic and international significance" and "a creative masterpiece."
<br><br>
Following the promulgation of the Basic Law, the Chinese government began preparation work for the establishment of the HKSAR. In July 1993, the NPC Standing Committee authorized the formation of the Preliminary Working Commission of the Preparatory Committee of the HKSAR (the Preliminary Working Commission). In January 1996, the Preparatory Committee of the HKSAR of the NPC (the Preparatory Committee) was established. Both the commission and the committee did a great deal of work for the smooth transition and transfer of government in Hong Kong.
<br><br>
On July 1, 1997, the Chinese government resumed its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. At the same time, the HKSAR was established and the Basic Law came into effect. Hong Kong entered a new epoch characterized by "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy. As members of the big Chinese family, the people of Hong Kong and the people of the mainland share the pride and glory of the great mother country, and bear the common responsibility and mission of rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
<br><br>
II. Establishment of the Special Administrative Region System in Hong Kong
<br><br>
The system of the special administrative region, as prescribed in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the Basic Law of the HKSAR, is a special administrative system developed by the state for certain regions. Under this system, the central government exercises overall jurisdiction over the HKSAR, including the powers directly exercised by the central government, and the powers delegated to the HKSAR by the central government to enable it to exercise a high degree of autonomy in accordance with the law. The central government has the power of oversight over the exercise of a high degree of autonomy in the HKSAR.<br><br>

1. The Central Leadership Directly Exercises Jurisdiction over the HKSAR in Accordance with the Law
<br><br>
As prescribed in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the Basic Law of the HKSAR, the organs of power by which the central leadership directly exercises jurisdiction over the HKSAR are the NPC and its Standing Committee, the president of the state, the Central People's Government, and the Central Military Commission. The NPC decided on the establishment of the HKSAR, formulated the Basic Law of the HKSAR to prescribe the system to be instituted in the HKSAR, and has the power of amendment to the Basic Law. The NPC Standing Committee has the power of interpretation regarding the Basic Law of the HKSAR, the power of decision on revising the selection methods of the chief executive and the Legislative Council of the HKSAR, the power of supervision over the laws formulated by the legislative organs of the HKSAR, the power of decision on the HKSAR entering a state of emergency, and the power of making new authorization for the HKSAR. The HKSAR comes directly under the Central People's Government, and its chief executive is accountable to the Central People's Government. The Central People's Government appoints the chief executive and the principal officials, is responsible for foreign affairs relating to the HKSAR in accordance with the law, and issues directives to the chief executive. The Central Military Commission is the leading body of the Hong Kong garrison, and performs defense and other duties. The central authorities perform overall jurisdiction and constitutional duties as prescribed in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and in the Basic Law of the HKSAR, and exercise effective administration over the HKSAR.
<br><br>
-Forming the power organs of the HKSAR. Prior to the return of Hong Kong, the Preparatory Committee of the HKSAR completed the organization of the Selection Committee of the First Government of the HKSAR. The Selection Committee elected Tung Chee-hwa as the first chief executive of the HKSAR, and then the Central People's Government appointed him as the chief executive. The Selection Committee also elected members of the interim Legislative Council. The first chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, appointed the judges of the Court of Final Appeal, and the chief justice of the High Court. The completion of the above work ensured the effective administration of the HKSAR by the central leadership upon its establishment. After the return of Hong Kong to China, the Central People's Government appointed Tung Chee-hwa, Donald Tsang and Leung Chun-ying, all elected, as chief executives of the HKSAR in that order, and appointed and dismissed key officials of their administrations. China's state leaders attended the inauguration ceremonies of the chief executives and key government officials, and heard them take their oaths of office.<br><br>

-Supporting and guiding the administration of the chief executive and government of the HKSAR in accordance with the law. The chief executive reports his/her work to the central government on an annual basis, on the implementation of the Basic Law and other items for which he/she is accountable to the central government; and the state leaders give guidance to the chief executive on major matters related to the implementation of the Basic Law. The central government has established the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council as an administrative office of the State Council to handle Hong Kong and Macau affairs. The office works to implement the "one country, two systems" principle and related directives of the central government, and is responsible for communicating with the government of the HKSAR. The Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR is a resident organ of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong. Its duties involve communication with the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the HKSAR and the PLA Hong Kong Garrison, the promotion of exchanges and cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland in various areas, communication with personages from all sectors of Hong Kong society, and the handling of affairs involving Taiwan.
<br><br>
-Responsible for foreign affairs involving the HKSAR. First, the central leadership supports the HKSAR in actively carrying out international exchanges and cooperation; supports and assists the HKSAR in participating in international organizations and conferences in a proper capacity; assists the HKSAR in bidding to host important international conferences of various kinds, and supports the HKSAR in developing international conference centers, regional legal services and dispute settlement centers; supports the recommendation of Hong Kong residents to take up posts in international organizations; supports the promotion of visa waivers for HKSAR passport holders in other countries and regions; and supports the work of trade offices of the HKSAR government in other countries and regions. Second, the role of the central leadership also includes properly handling legal issues involving Hong Kong, such as the application of international conventions in Hong Kong. The number of multilateral treaties and amendments that have become applicable in the HKSAR now exceeds 170, and the number of agreements concluded with other countries with the authorization of the central government regarding investment protection, civil aviation, taxation and judicial assistance has reached 338. The central government assists the HKSAR in accepting reviews on the implementation of international conventions, supports it in maintaining and developing ties, and in signing and implementing treaties and agreements with other countries, regions and related international organizations in the name of "Hong Kong, China" in the areas of economy, trade, finance, maritime transport, communications, tourism, culture and sports. It also authorizes and assists Hong Kong in conducting judicial cooperation with other countries. Third, it ratifies the establishment of consulates and other governmental or quasi-governmental organizations of foreign countries in the HKSAR. Currently, there are 66 consulates-general set up by foreign countries under related agreements in the HKSAR, with 73 honorary consuls. Fourth, it strives to ensure the safety and legitimate rights and interests of Hong Kong compatriots while in other countries, and actively offers consular protection to Hong Kong travelers abroad. By the end of 2013, Chinese embassies and consulates overseas had handled over 10,000 cases of consular protection involving Hong Kong residents. Fifth, it prevents foreign forces from interfering in Hong Kong's affairs. Hong Kong's affairs are internal affairs of China, and the Chinese government has made timely representations with certain countries through diplomatic channels regarding their words and actions of interference. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has established the Office of the Commissioner in the HKSAR to attend to foreign affairs involving Hong Kong.<br><br>

-Responsible for the defense of the HKSAR. The central leadership made the decision and authorized the formation of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Hong Kong Garrison in January 1996, and on December 30 the same year, the 23rd Session of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee adopted the Law of the People's Republic of China on Garrisoning the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. At midnight on July 1, 1997, troops of the PLA Hong Kong Garrison entered Hong Kong to take over the defense of the HKSAR. The Garrison's duties include guarding against and resisting aggression, ensuring the security of the HKSAR, performing defense services, managing military installations, and handling military affairs involving other countries in accordance with the law. The Garrison adheres to the law in performing its duties, and oversees military conduct in accordance with the law. It diligently fulfills its duties in defense, organizing sea and air patrols and carrying out search and rescue exercises in case of maritime or air emergencies, joint exercises of combined arms, and cross-district maneuvers, vigorously safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Garrison also actively takes part in activities to promote the public good in Hong Kong, inviting local residents to visit the Garrison barracks and holding summer military camps for young students, in an effort to strengthen ties between the Garrison and the local community. All this has helped enhance the mutual understanding and trust between the Garrison and the people of Hong Kong, fully exemplifying the valor and good conduct of the PLA.<br><br>

-Exercising power granted to the NPC Standing Committee by the Constitution of the PRC and the Basic Law of the HKSAR. First, the NPC Standing Committee keeps record of the laws drawn up by the legislature of the HKSAR for review. By the end of 2013, the HKSAR had reported a total of 570 local laws to the NPC Standing Committee for the record. Second, it adds or subtracts national laws applicable in the HKSAR as listed in Annex III of the Basic Law of the HKSAR. Currently, 12 national laws are listed in Annex III of the Basic Law of the HKSAR for implementation. Third, it makes new authorizations to the HKSAR. In 1996, the NPC Standing Committee empowered the HKSAR government to appoint its immigration department as the office to accept applications for nationality in the HKSAR and handle the applications in accordance with the Nationality Law and its interpretations. In 2006, the NPC Standing Committee authorized the HKSAR to run the Hong Kong section of the Shenzhen Bay Port in accordance with the laws of the HKSAR. Fourth, it makes interpretations regarding the Basic Law of the HKSAR. The NPC Standing Committee made interpretations of the related articles of the Basic Law in 1999, 2004, 2005 and 2011 on the following questions respectively: the right of abode in Hong Kong for permanent Hong Kong residents' children born outside Hong Kong and with Chinese nationality, the legal procedure for modifying the selection methods of the chief executive and the Legislative Council, the length of the term of a by-elected chief executive, and the principles of state immunity, and interpretations of relevant provisions in the Basic Law and its appendixes. Fifth, it decides on issues relating to the constitutional development in the HKSAR. The NPC Standing Committee made decisions in 2004 and 2007, respectively, on the selection method of the chief executive for 2007 and the Legislative Council for 2008, and the selection method of the chief executive, the Legislative Council and the general election for 2012. Sixth, it ratifies and keeps record of the amendments to the selection methods of the chief executive and Legislative Council of the HKSAR. In 2010, the NPC Standing Committee ratified the HKSAR's amendment to the selection method of the chief executive for 2012, agreeing to put on record the amendment to the selection method and voting procedure of the Legislative Council for 2012. Seventh, it keeps records of the appointment and removal of the judges of the Court of Final Appeal and the chief judge of the High Court of the HKSAR. In addition, according to the Basic Law of the HKSAR and relevant decisions of the NPC, the Basic Law Committee of the HKSAR of the NPC Standing Committee, established on July 1, 1997, when the Basic Law came into effect, is composed of members from the mainland and Hong Kong, and is responsible for providing opinions to the NPC Standing Committee on issues such as whether the laws drawn up by the HKSAR's legislature comply with the provisions of the Basic Law on the range of affairs responsible by the central government and the relationship between the central government and the HKSAR, on adding or subtracting the national laws applicable in Hong Kong as listed in Annex III and on the interpretation or revision of the Basic Law, and related issues.<br><br>


2. The HKSAR Exercises a High Degree of Autonomy in Accordance with the Law<br><br>

After the establishment of the HKSAR, the previous capitalist system and way of life remain unchanged in Hong Kong, and existing laws remain basically unchanged. Adhering to the law, the HKSAR protects the right of ownership of private property, maintains the status of Hong Kong as a free port and a separate customs territory, maintains independent finances, practices an independent taxation system, and formulates its own policies regarding trade, finance, education, science, culture, public health and sports. In accordance with the Basic Law of the HKSAR and the decision of the NPC Standing Committee on handling the laws previously practiced in Hong Kong, the laws previously in force in Hong Kong, that is, the common law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation and customary law are maintained, except for any that contravene the Basic Law and are subject to any amendment by the legislature of the HKSAR. On this basis, the HKSAR exercises a high degree of autonomy, and fully exercises its administrative, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication.<br><br>

The chief executive of the HKSAR is the head of the Special Administrative Region. He/she represents the HKSAR and is accountable to both the Central People's Government and the HKSAR. The chief executive is also the head of the government of the Special Administrative Region, and exercises powers and functions conferred by the Basic Law, such as leading the government of the region and being responsible for the implementation of the Basic Law. While exercising his/her powers and functions, the chief executive shall implement the directives issued by the Central People's Government in respect of the relevant matters provided for in the Basic Law of the HKSAR. The government of the HKSAR is composed of permanent residents of Hong Kong in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Basic Law, with a Department of Administration, a Department of Finance, a Department of Justice, and various bureaus, divisions and commissions to exercise powers and functions such as formulating and implementing policies and conducting administrative affairs, as prescribed by the Basic Law. The HKSAR enjoys administrative power in a wide range of areas, including the economy, education, science, culture, sports, religion, social services, public order, and control of entry and exit of the region. In addition, the HKSAR conducts external affairs as authorized by the Central People's Government.<br><br>

The Legislative Council of the HKSAR is the legislature of the HKSAR. It is formed by election, and exercises the following powers and functions in accordance with the Basic Law: enacting, amending or repealing laws in accordance with the provisions of the Basic Law and legal procedures; examining and approving budgets introduced by the government, and approving taxation and public expenditure, among others. The HKSAR enjoys legislative power in a wide range of areas, and is empowered to formulate laws relating to civil, criminal and commercial affairs, as well as judicial proceedings, for application in the region in accordance with the Basic Law. The laws drawn up by the Legislative Council of the HKSAR must be reported to the NPC Standing Committee for the record. If the NPC Standing Committee, after consulting the Committee for the Basic Law of the HKSAR, considers that any law enacted by the legislature of the region is not in conformity with the provisions of the Basic Law regarding affairs within the responsibility of the central leadership or regarding the relationship between the central leadership and the region, the Standing Committee may return the law in question but shall not amend it. Any law returned by the NPC Standing Committee is immediately invalidated.<br><br>

The courts of the HKSAR at all levels are the judiciary of the region, exercising the judicial power of the region. After the establishment of the HKSAR, the Court of Final Appeal was established to exercise the power of final adjudication in the region. The judicial system previously practiced in Hong Kong is maintained except for those changes consequent upon the establishment of the Court of Final Appeal. The common law and relevant judicial principles and systems previously practiced in Hong Kong, including the principle of independent adjudication, the principle of following precedents, and the jury system, continue to apply. The courts of the HKSAR have no jurisdiction over acts of state such as defense and foreign affairs. They have jurisdiction over all civil and criminal cases in the region, except that the restrictions on their jurisdiction imposed by the legal system and principles previously in force in Hong Kong are maintained. When adjudicating cases, the courts of the HKSAR may refer to precedents of other common law jurisdictions, and the Court of Final Appeal may as required invite judges from other common law jurisdictions to sit in the Court of Final Appeal.
<br><br>
III. Comprehensive Progress Made in Various Undertakings in the HKSAR<br><br>

Since the establishment of the HKSAR, the government of the Special Administrative Region has, with energetic support from the central government and the mainland, rallied people of all walks of life in Hong Kong, worked hard and overcome difficulties, made full use of the advantage of the policy of "one country, two systems," maintained overall social, economic and political stability, promoted the development of all undertakings and made new achievements one after another.
<br><br>
-HKSAR residents' fundamental rights and freedoms are fully protected. Hong Kong residents enjoy basic rights and freedoms in accordance with the law, which are under the full protection of the Constitution, the Basic Law and the local laws. The Constitution and the Basic Law safeguard the HKSAR residents' fundamental rights and freedoms at the constitutional level. The HKSAR provides further protection to residents' rights and freedoms by enacting the Sex Discrimination Ordinance, Race Discrimination Ordinance, Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) Ordinance, Minimum Wage Ordinance and other ordinances. A multitude of organs, including the Equal Opportunity Commission, Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, Office of the Ombudsman, Legal Aid Department, Independent Police Complaints Council, Legal Aid Services Council, Women's Commission and Commission on Poverty, have been set up by the HKSAR government to help promote and protect HKSAR residents' fundamental rights and freedoms.In addition, the Basic Law explicitly stipulates that Chinese citizens who are residents of the HKSAR shall be entitled to participation in the management of state affairs according to law. In accordance with the assigned number of seats and the selection method specified by the NPC, the Chinese citizens among the HKSAR residents elect deputies of the region to the NPC to participate in the work of China's supreme organ of state power. The HKSAR has held in succession four such elections and 36 deputies were elected each time by the broadly representative Conference for Electing Deputies of the HKSAR to the NPC. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) always values the participation of Hong Kong compatriots. Aside from specially inviting Hong Kong personages, other CPPCC groups also include representatives from Hong Kong. The 12th CPPCC National Committee had a 124-member Hong Kong group, and 16 other CPPCC groups had 82 members from Hong Kong.<br><br>

-The democratic political system has been steadily promoted. Before the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997, the United Kingdom designated governors to enforce colonial rule over Hong Kong for more than 150 years. Since 1997, the HKSAR government and the legislature have been composed of local residents. The chief executive of the HKSAR is appointed by the Central People's Government on the basis of the results of elections or consultations held locally; the legislature of the HKSAR is established by elections. The Basic Law of the HKSAR explicitly stipulates that the chief executive and all the members of the Legislative Council must be elected by universal suffrage, making universal suffrage a legal objective. Since the establishment of the HKSAR, the central government and the HKSAR government have unswervingly and steadily promoted Hong Kong's democratic political system, featuring the election methods for the chief executive and the Legislative Council, according to the Basic Law and relevant decisions of the NPC Standing Committee.<br><br>

The election of the chief executive of the HKSAR has become increasingly democratic. Candidates for the first chief executive were elected by a 400-member Selection Committee, while candidates for the second, third and fourth chief executives were elected by the Election Committee, the membership of which in the meantime had grown from 800 to 1,200. Members of the Election Committee came from the four major sectors of "industry, commerce and finance," "the professions," "labor, social services, religious and other sectors" and "members of the Legislative Council, representatives of district boards and Heung Yee Kuk, HKSAR deputies to the NPC, and representatives of HKSAR members of the National Committee of the CPPCC" in equal proportions. Such a composition is an expression of equal participation and broad representativeness.
<br><br>
The election of the Legislative Council is becoming more and more direct. The first Legislative Council formed in 1998 had 20 members elected directly by geographical constituencies, 30 members by functional constituencies, and ten members by the Election Committee. The second Legislative Council formed in 2000 had 24 members elected directly by geographical constituencies, 30 members by functional constituencies, and six members by the Election Committee. The third and fourth Legislative Councils formed respectively in 2004 and 2008 both had 30 members elected directly by geographical constituencies, and 30 members by functional constituencies. The membership of the fifth Legislative Council elected in 2012 expanded to 70, including 35 members elected directly by geographical constituencies and 35 members by functional constituencies. The additional five members elected by functional constituencies were nominated by district boards, and elected by voters who had enjoyed no right to vote under functional constituencies.
<br><br>
The timetable has been set for universal suffrage. The 31st Session of the Standing Committee of the Tenth NPC made a decision on December 29, 2007 "that the election of the fifth chief executive of the HKSAR in 2017 may be implemented by the method of universal suffrage; that after the chief executive is selected by universal suffrage, the election of the Legislative Council of the HKSAR may be implemented by the method of electing all the members by universal suffrage," thus setting a timetable for the selection of the chief executive and all members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage. From December 4, 2013 to May 3, 2014, the HKSAR government initiated a five-month public consultation on the election of the chief executive in 2017 and that of the Legislative Council in 2016, starting the relevant procedures for introducing universal suffrage.<br><br>

-The HKSAR has maintained steady economic growth. From 1997 to 2013, Hong Kong's Gross Regional Product (GRP) grew by 3.4 percent annually in real terms, and its per-capita GRP increased by a total of 39.3 percent calculated in US dollar. According to the 2013 statistics of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Hong Kong's GRP and per-capita GRP, respectively, ranked the 35th and 7th in the world, as calculated by purchasing power parity.
<br><br>
Hong Kong has maintained and enhanced its status as an international financial, trade and shipping center. As an important international banking center, Hong Kong boasts the world's sixth-largest securities market and fifth-largest foreign exchange market. Hong Kong ranks high in various lists of international financial centers. As the world's ninth-largest trading economy, Hong Kong has regular trading ties with almost every country and region in the world. Hong Kong is one of the world's largest container shipping ports and fourth-largest ship-registration center. The Hong Kong International Airport is one of the world's busiest. Its air freight volume has led the world for many years, and its passenger transport volume ranks fifth.<br><br>

Hong Kong's robust industries have been strengthened even further. Trade and logistics, tourism, finance, and professional services and support services for industry and commerce continue to play an important role as Hong Kong's four pillar industries. In 2012, these four sectors employed 47.2 percent of Hong Kong's total working population, and their added value accounted for 58 percent of Hong Kong's total GRP. Hong Kong also focuses on the cultivation and development of the cultural and creative, innovation and technology, testing and certification, and environmental protection industries.
<br><br>
Hong Kong has maintained a sound business environment, and is generally recognized as one of the world's freest economies. For many years, it has ranked high in the World Bank's evaluation of business environments of 185 economies. In its World Investment Report 2013, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) ranked Hong Kong the third in the world in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). For many years, Hong Kong has been listed among the world's most competitive economies by the World Competitiveness Yearbook compiled by the International Institute for Management Development based in Lausanne, Switzerland.
<br><br>
-Social programs have been further enhanced. Hong Kong leads the Asia-Pacific region in education, as the HKSAR government continues to increase its investment in education, the biggest government expenditure item. During the 2014-2015 fiscal year, the HKSAR government's current budgetary spending on education reached HK$75.37 billion. Since the 2008-2009 school year, Hong Kong has implemented 12-year free education in public schools. The University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology are among Asia's top-ten universities, according to the Times Higher Education Asian University Rankings 2013. The University of Hong Kong was the 43rd according to the World University Rankings 2013-2014. Hong Kong continues to rank high in the global test of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012, which reflects the quality of primary education.<br><br>
Hong Kong continues to provide quality medical and health care services. During the 2014-2015 fiscal year, the HKSAR government's budget for expenditure on medical and health care is HK$52.4 billion, accounting for 17 percent of the government's recurrent expenditure. All Hong Kong residents enjoy equal access to affordable public medical services. By the end of 2012, Hong Kong had more than 35,500 beds in various medical institutions. The infant mortality rate dropped from 4 per thousand in 1997 to 1.6 per thousand in 2013, which is among the world's lowest. In 2013, the life expectancy of Hong Kong's male and female residents was 80.9 years and 86.6 years, respectively, which are among the world's highest.
<br><br>
Cultural and sports activities are flourishing in Hong Kong, where the Chinese and foreign cultures intermingle. The HKSAR government encourages the diverse development of Hong Kong's culture and promotes cultural exchanges. Four unique Hong Kong cultural events were added to the third batch of the State-level Non-material Cultural Heritage List, namely, Yu Lan Ghost Festival, Tai Hang fire dragon dance, Tai O dragon boat parade, and Cheung Chau Jiao Festival. Hong Kong hosted the equestrian events of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, and the fifth East Asian Games in 2009. Hong Kong athletes have excelled themselves in events such as windsurfing, table tennis, cycling and martial arts during the Olympics, World Championships and Asian Championships.<br><br>

Hong Kong's social security service has been continuously improved. During the fiscal year 2014-2015 the HKSAR government's budget for social welfare reached HK$61.9 billion, 3.03 times as compared with the HK$20.4 billion during the fiscal year 1997-1998. Hong Kong has put in place a multilayer and diversified social security and welfare service system. Hong Kong has more than 400 social service agencies, and the number of registered social workers has increased from 8,300 at the end of 1998 to more than 18,000 today. The HKSAR government actively promotes the construction of public housing, moves low-wage residents into public housing, and provides financial aid to those who purchase housing units. Around half of Hong Kong's residents live in housing provided or funded by the government. Among them, more than 2 million live in rented public housing, and over 1 million have purchased housing units with government financial aid.
<br><br>
-Hong Kong's international exchanges and its international influence have further expanded. Hong Kong's international exchanges have been broadened. By June 2013, Hong Kong, as a member of a Chinese government delegation or in other appropriate capacities, had participated in 41 events held by inter-governmental international organizations, and joined 37 inter-governmental international organizations whose membership is not limited to sovereign states. As a member of a Chinese government delegation or in other appropriate capacities, Hong Kong has attended more than 1,400 international meetings; using the name of "Hong Kong, China" it has attended more than 20,000 international meetings not limited to states. It has also hosted or co-hosted more than 1,000 international meetings. The HKSAR has visa waiver agreements with 42 countries, and 150 countries or regions provide visa-free entry or grant visas upon arrival to HKSAR passports holders. Hong Kong has civil air transport agreements, agreements on avoidance of double taxation, agreements on investment promotion and protection, and agreements on criminal justice assistance with many countries. The HKSAR government has economic and trade offices in 11 places, such as Geneva, London, Tokyo, New York and Berlin. Six international organizations, including the European Commission, have representative offices in Hong Kong.
<br><br>
Outstanding Hong Kong professionals have taken important positions in international organizations. Supported by the central government, Chan Fung Fu-chun, former director of health of the HKSAR, was elected director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) in November 2006, and was reelected in May 2012. She is the first Chinese to head an inter-government international organization since the founding of the United Nations. Shun Chi-ming, director of the Hong Kong Observatory, was elected president of the Commission for Aeronautical Meteorology of the World Meteorological Organization in February 2010.

IV. Efforts Made by the Central Government to Ensure the Prosperity and Development of the HKSAR
<br><br>
The central government has always given high priority to Hong Kong's economic development and improvement of its people's livelihood, and fully supported it in meeting various difficulties and challenges. It gives full play to its role in adopting and executing the national development strategy, and actively promotes exchanges and cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland, thus providing solid backing for Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
<br><br>
1. Supporting the HKSAR in Defusing Risks and Meeting Challenges
<br><br>
-Supporting Hong Kong in the fight against the Asian financial crisis. In 1997, the Asian financial crisis broke out, and spread rapidly around the region. Hong Kong was attacked by international speculative forces, its financial market was volatile, its dollar pegged exchange rate system came under attack, and its financial system faced a grave threat. Given these circumstances, the central government solemnly announced that it would safeguard the stability and prosperity of the HKSAR at all costs, strongly support the HKSAR government in protecting the pegged exchange rate system, and not depreciate the RMB. With this support from the central government, the HKSAR government took swift measures that ensured the stability of its financial system and the Hong Kong society.
<br><br>
-Supporting Hong Kong in the fight against SARS. In the first half of 2003, the SARS epidemic hit Hong Kong. It not only posed a threat to the lives and health of the Hong Kong people, but also dealt a blow to Hong Kong's economy that had not recovered from the Asian financial crisis, resulting in deflation, market slump and a high unemployment rate of 8.7 percent. To ensure the safety of life of the Hong Kong people and help the Hong Kong economy climb out of recession, the central government promptly lent a helping hand. Although the mainland also needed medical supplies in the fight against SARS, the central government provided a large quantity of free medical supplies to Hong Kong. The Chinese leaders also went to the hardest-hit areas and hospitals of Hong Kong to inspect local conditions and console victims. On June 29, the mainland and Hong Kong signed the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), which outlines the steps that the mainland and Hong Kong should take in trade in goods and services, and trade and investment facilitation as well as the goals to be achieved. Later, the Individual Visit Scheme was introduced, allowing mainland residents to visit Hong Kong on their own. These measures helped Hong Kong overcome the SARS attack and boosted its economic growth.
<br><br>
-Supporting Hong Kong in the fight against the international financial crisis. When the international financial crisis broke out in the second half of 2008, the central government was highly concerned about its impact on Hong Kong. In December of that year, it introduced 14 policies to ensure economic and financial stability in Hong Kong. In January 2009, the central government launched more policies, including the signing of a RMB200 billion currency swap agreement by the People's Bank of China with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Later, when visiting Hong Kong, the Chinese leaders announced a number of policies to support Hong Kong's economic development, improve the local people's livelihood, and strengthen its exchanges and cooperation with the mainland. All these policies played a positive role in boosting confidence, strengthening capability to defuse risks and stimulating the economic recovery of Hong Kong.
<br><br>
2. Supporting the HKSAR in Reinforcing and Enhancing Its Competitive Strengths
<br><br>
-Supporting Hong Kong as an international center of finance, trade and shipping. The central government supports Hong Kong in launching individual use of RMB, issuing RMB bonds and conducting trials of RMB settlement in cross-border trade, thus consolidating Hong Kong's position as a leading offshore RMB market. It has continued to encourage the listing of mainland enterprises on the stock market in Hong Kong, and introduced other measures to support Hong Kong's financial sector. In 2013, a total of 216 Hong Kong banks joined the RMB clearing platform, and the amount of cross-border RMB settlement in Hong Kong reached RMB3.84 trillion, accounting for 82.9 percent of the total cross-border RMB settlement of China. The balance of Hong Kong's RMB customer deposits and depository receipts reached RMB1 trillion. Hong Kong has become the world's largest offshore RMB trading center. After the signing of the CEPA in 2003 and its coming into force in January 2004, the mainland signed and implemented ten supplementary agreements with Hong Kong. The mainland now gives zero tariff treatment to all products of Hong Kong origin. From that time to the end of 2013, the mainland imported from Hong Kong goods worth US$7.161 billion under the CEPA, with tariff preference of RMB3.983 billion for Hong Kong. The mainland also adopted a total of 403 liberalization measures in respect of trade in services. Based on WTO classification, the mainland has opened to Hong Kong 149 areas of trade in services under the CEPA and its supplementary agreements, accounting for 93.1 percent of the total number of such areas of the mainland. This makes the CEPA the most open agreement on free trade that the mainland has ever signed. In addition, Guangdong Province has adopted 82 pilot measures to open its services industries to Hong Kong. When drawing up the National Plan for the Layout of Coastal Ports, and the 12th Five-Year Plan for the Comprehensive Development of Transportation Systems, the central government took into account the need to consolidate and enhance Hong Kong's position as an international shipping center.
<br><br>
-Supporting Hong Kong in developing its tourism and retail sectors, and Hong Kong-invested companies on the mainland. At the request of the HKSAR government, the central government gradually expanded the Individual Visit Scheme to 49 pilot cities, with a total population of over 300 million. By the end of 2013, some 129 million mainland residents had visited Hong Kong under the Individual Visit Scheme. According to estimate of the HKSAR government, in 2012 alone the Individual Visit Scheme contributed to 1.3 percent increase of Hong Kong's GRP of the year, and it created more than 110,000 jobs, accounting for 3.1 percent of the local employment. To bring more benefits to medium-sized and small businesses and residents in Hong Kong, the central government also allows Hong Kong residents to start individual businesses on the mainland. By the end of 2013, a total of 5,982 individual businesses opened by Hong Kong residents had been registered on the mainland, employing 16,476 people. The central government encourages the development of Hong Kong processing and trading companies on the mainland, and has assisted the transformation and upgrading of Hong Kong-invested companies on the mainland. In 2009, Guangdong Province introduced 30 policies to help companies established with Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan investment weather the international financial crisis and accelerate their transformation and upgrading. In December 2011, the central government issued the Guidelines on Promoting the Transformation and Upgrading of Processing Trade, and set up demonstration zones and pilot cities for the transformation and upgrading of processing trade in Suzhou and Dongguan, as well as 44 key areas in central and western China to relocate enterprises of processing trade in a phased way.
<br><br>

3. Supporting the HKSAR in Strengthening Exchanges and Cooperation in Various Fields with the Mainland
<br><br>
Since Hong Kong's return to China in 1997, the central government has made the maintenance of its prosperity and stability an important part of the country's overall development strategy. Both the 10th and 11th Five-Year Plans stress the need to ensure lasting prosperity and stability in Hong Kong, and strengthen its position as an international center of finance, trade and shipping. In the 12th Five-Year Plan, for the first time, the development of Hong Kong and Macau is dealt with in an independent section. This has further defined Hong Kong's strategic position in China's development strategy and stressed the state support for Hong Kong in enhancing its competitive edge, fostering emerging industries and deepening economic cooperation with the mainland.
<br><br>
-Supporting the HKSAR further in developing economic and trade cooperation with the mainland. The implementation of the CEPA and its supplementary agreements has removed a great deal of institutional barriers in trade, investment and other sectors between Hong Kong and the mainland, strengthened their economic and trade relations, and broadened the range of cooperation, with both sides benefiting from their cooperation. Currently, the mainland is the largest trading partner of Hong Kong. According to Hong Kong statistics, in 2013 the trade volume between Hong Kong and the mainland reached HK$3.8913 trillion, 3.49 times that of 1997 and accounting for 51.1 percent of Hong Kong's external trade. At the same time, Hong Kong is the mainland's most important trading partner, a key export market and the mainland's largest off-shore financial center. By the end of 2013, mainland enterprises listed in Hong Kong had totaled 797, accounting for 48.5 percent of the total number of Hong Kong listed companies. In addition, their total market value had reached HK$13.7 trillion, accounting for 56.9 percent of the total value of the Hong Kong stock market. In addition, the mainland and Hong Kong are each other's largest source of overseas direct investment (ODI). By the end of 2013, Hong Kong's ODI from the mainland had exceeded US$358.8 billion, accounting for nearly 60 percent of the mainland's total ODI; the mainland had approved nearly 360,000 projects with Hong Kong investment, involving US$665.67 billion in total and accounting for 47.7 percent of the mainland's total ODI.<br><br>

-Supporting the HKSAR in strengthening cooperation with mainland provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government, particularly Guangdong Province. The central government has endorsed the establishment of the Hong Kong-Guangdong Cooperation Joint Conference, and the Pan-Pearl River Delta Regional Cooperation and Development Forum. It approved the implementation of the Outline of the Plan for the Reform and Development of the Pearl River Delta (2008-2020), the Overall Development Plan of Hengqin, the Overall Development Plan for the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone, and the Development Plan for the Nansha New District of Guangzhou, and approved the signing by Guangdong with the HKSAR of the Framework Agreement on Hong Kong-Guangdong Cooperation, which identifies the three key areas of cooperation, namely, building the Hengqin New District of Zhuhai, the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone and the Nansha New District of Guangzhou, the central government has urged Guangdong and Hong Kong to work together to build more competitive world-class urban cluster with cutting-edge manufacturing and service industries. The central government has also approved the establishment by the HKSAR of regional cooperation mechanisms with Beijing and Shanghai, and supported the HKSAR government to set up offices on the mainland. Currently, in addition to its Beijing Office, the HKSAR government has also set up commercial offices in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chengdu and Wuhan, and liaison offices in Shenzhen, Chongqing and Fuzhou, which are instrumental in promoting Hong Kong's economic and trade cooperation with the various localities in the mainland and exchanges in other areas.<br><br>

-Supporting efforts by the HKSAR and the mainland in cross-border infrastructure construction and facilitation for personnel and cargo customs clearance. The Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor, which opened to traffic in 2007, has become the fourth land passage linking Hong Kong with the mainland. The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, the construction of which started in 2009 and scheduled for completion in 2016, will connect Hong Kong in the east and Zhuhai and Macau in the west, and will become a new road transport corridor linking eastern and western banks of the Pearl River. The Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong High-Speed Railway, when completed, will connect Hong Kong with China's national high-speed rail network. As things stand now, the mainland and Hong Kong have achieved full mutual recognition of inspection results at all land and water ports. In 2013, a total of 40.75 million mainland residents visited Hong Kong, which was 17.3 times that of 1997; while 76.88 million Hong Kong residents visited the mainland, up from 39.77 million in 1997.<br><br>

-Supporting the HKSAR in strengthening exchanges and cooperation with the mainland in education, science and technology, culture and some other fields. The central government has supported universities of Hong Kong and the mainland in enrolling students from each other; supported cooperation in academic affairs between institutions of higher learning of Hong Kong and the mainland, and supported teaching staff and students from the two sides in carrying out exchange activities. It has supported Hong Kong's institutions of higher learning, research bodies and the science and technology parks in Hong Kong in setting up Partner Labs of Key State Laboratories, the Hong Kong branch of the National Engineering Research Center and the National High-tech Industrialization Base; supported Hong Kong universities in establishing research institutes in Shenzhen; supported Hong Kong science workers and institutions in applying for projects under China's National Research Program; and endeavored to make the country's key sci-tech projects more accessible to Hong Kong. In 2005, the mainland and Hong Kong signed the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Cultural Ties Arrangement Agreement, launching overall cooperation in cultural conservation, and industrial development and exchanges. The central government supported Hong Kong, Macau and Guangdong in jointly and successfully including the Yueju opera in the UNESCO's Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2009; and supported Hong Kong's successful bid to list its Geopark in Sai Kung as part of the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network in 2011. It has also supported Hong Kong in joint production of films with the mainland; since the signing of the CEPA, Hong Kong and the mainland have worked together in producing 322 films, accounting for 70 percent of mainland's total in such area. The central government has supported Hong Kong in cooperating with the mainland in sports personnel exchanges, training and some other aspects. It invites Hong Kong athletes to take part in National Games and other events. It has also supported exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the development of traditional Chinese medicine, health care management, notification and prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, notification and cooperation in cases of public health crises, etc.<br><br>

-Supporting the HKSAR government in establishing exchange and cooperation mechanisms with relevant departments of the central government. The HKSAR government has established a number of exchange and cooperation mechanisms at different levels and covering different areas with relevant departments of the central government to coordinate and promote related work. For example, the two sides established the CEPA Joint Steering Committee to oversee the implementation of the CEPA, solve problems, and supplement and amend the CEPA; and cooperation mechanisms in the areas of entry-and-exit control, customs, inspection and quarantine, finance, public health, tourism and other fields, to promote communication, jointly handle emergencies and combat illegal activities. In addition, the central government established a Joint Inter-ministerial Conference System for the Promotion of Qianhai, Nansha and Hengqin, to strengthen guidance, coordination and services for the development and building of the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone, Nansha New District in Guangzhou and Hengqin New District in Zhuhai; and the HKSAR government is a member of this system. These mechanisms have played a positive role in promoting mutually beneficial cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland, and in handling related issues of regional development and governance of common concern.<br><br>

4. Ensuring Secure and Stable Supplies of Basic Necessities to the HKSAR<br><br>

Because of the limitations of its natural environment, Hong Kong mainly relies on the mainland for the supply of fresh water, vegetables, meat and other basic necessities. Since the early 1960s, when the mainland opened "three express trains" to supply Hong Kong with fresh and frozen goods, and started the Dongjiang-Shenzhen Water Supply Project, the central government and the relevant local governments on the mainland have made great efforts to ensure the supply of foodstuff, agricultural and sideline products, water, electricity, natural gas, etc., to the HKSAR. By the end of 2013, some 95 percent of live pigs, 100 percent of live cattle, 33 percent of live chicken, 100 percent of freshwater fish, 90 percent of vegetables and 70 percent or more of flour on the Hong Kong market had been supplied by the mainland. The first pass yield of foodstuff supplied by the mainland to Hong Kong has maintained at a fairly high level. In 2013, in accordance with the revised agreement, Guangdong supplied Hong Kong with 606 million cu m of fresh water. From 1994, the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant started to supply Hong Kong with electricity, and now its annual power supply accounts for a quarter of the annual power consumption of Hong Kong. In 2013, the mainland supplied Hong Kong with 2.531 billion cu m of natural gas.

V. Fully and Accurately Understanding and Implementing the Policy of "One Country, Two Systems"
<br><br>
As a groundbreaking initiative, "one country, two systems" is a major issue of governance to the central leadership, and marks a major historical turning point for Hong Kong and Hong Kong people as well. While comprehensive progress has been made on all fronts in the HKSAR, the practice of "one country, two systems" has come to face new circumstances and new problems. Some people in Hong Kong have yet felt comfortable with the changes. Still some are even confused or lopsided in their understanding of "one country, two systems" and the Basic Law. Many wrong views that are currently rife in Hong Kong concerning its economy, society and development of its political structure are attributable to this. The continued practice of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong requires that we proceed from the fundamental objectives of maintaining China's sovereignty, security and development interests and maintaining the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong to fully and accurately understand and implement the policy of "one country, two systems," and holistically combine upholding the principle of "one country" with respecting the difference of "two systems," maintaining the power of the central government with ensuring the high degree of autonomy of the HKSAR, and letting the mainland play its role as a strong supporter of the HKSAR with improving the competitive edge of Hong Kong. In no circumstance should we do one thing and neglect the other.<br><br>

1. Fully and Accurately Understanding the Meaning of "One Country, Two Systems"
<br><br>
"One country, two systems" is a holistic concept. The "one country" means that within the PRC, HKSAR is an inseparable part and a local administrative region directly under China's Central People's Government. As a unitary state, China's central government has comprehensive jurisdiction over all local administrative regions, including the HKSAR. The high degree of autonomy of HKSAR is not an inherent power, but one that comes solely from the authorization by the central leadership. The high degree of autonomy of the HKSAR is not full autonomy, nor a decentralized power. It is the power to run local affairs as authorized by the central leadership. The high degree of autonomy of HKSAR is subject to the level of the central leadership's authorization. There is no such thing called "residual power." With China's Constitution stipulating in clear-cut terms that the country follows a fundamental system of socialism, the basic system, core leadership and guiding thought of the "one country" have been explicitly provided for. The most important thing to do in upholding the "one country" principle is to maintain China's sovereignty, security and development interests, and respect the country's fundamental system and other systems and principles.<br><br>

The "two systems" means that, within the "one country" the main body of the country practices socialism, while Hong Kong and some other regions practice capitalism. The "one country" is the premise and basis of the "two systems," and the "two systems" is subordinate to and derived from "one country." But the "two systems" under the "one country" are not on a par with each other. The fact that the mainland, the main body of the country, embraces socialism will not change. With that as the premise, and taking into account the history of Hong Kong and some other regions, capitalism is allowed to stay on a long-term basis. Therefore, a socialist system by the mainland is the prerequisite and guarantee for Hong Kong's practicing capitalism and maintaining its stability and prosperity. For Hong Kong to retain its capitalist system and enjoy a high degree of autonomy with "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" according to the Basic Law, it must fully respect the socialist system practiced on the mainland in keeping with the "one country" principle and, in particular, the political system and other systems and principles in practice. The mainland should respect and tolerate the capitalism embraced by Hong Kong while upholding its socialist system, and draw on the successful experience of Hong Kong in economic development and social management. Only by respecting and learning from each other can the "two systems" in the "one country" coexist harmoniously and achieve common development.<br><br>

2. Resolutely Safeguarding the Authority of the Constitution of the PRC and the Basic Law of Hong Kong<br><br>

The Constitution of the PRC and the Basic Law together constitute the constitutional basis of the HKSAR. As the fundamental law of the country, the Constitution, with supreme legal status and the highest legal authority, is applicable throughout the territory of the People's Republic of China, including the HKSAR. The Basic Law, which was formulated in accordance with the Constitution, provides for the system of the HKSAR and enjoys the legal status as its constitutional law. The systems and policies of the HKSAR are all based on the provisions of the Basic Law; no law enacted by the legislature of the HKSAR shall contravene the Basic Law. All the executive, legislative and judicial practices in the HKSAR must conform to the Basic Law. And all individuals, groups and organizations of the HKSAR shall obey the Basic Law. As a national law, the Basic Law is applicable throughout the country.<br><br>

We should have a full understanding of the provisions of the Basic Law. All the provisions of the Basic Law underlie the HKSAR system. They are not isolated from but interrelated with each other. Each of these provisions must be understood in the context of the Basic Law and the HKSAR system as a whole. The implementation of the Basic Law shows that if we comprehend individual provisions of the Basic Law in an isolated way without taking into account the Basic Law as a whole, stressing one aspect while ignoring others, ambiguity or even contentious interpretation will occur, which will severely hamper the implementation of the Basic Law. Only by comprehensively understanding all the provisions of the Basic Law can we find that the HKSAR system, along with all its components, is an integrated whole complementary to each other and that this system plays the role of protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents, and ensures the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.<br><br>

We should respect and uphold the power of interpretation and amendment of the Basic Law vested in the NPC and its Standing Committee. The Basic Law provides that the power of interpretation of the Basic Law shall be vested in the NPC Standing Committee, and the power of amendment shall be vested in the NPC. The Basic Law also provides that the courts of the HKSAR, in the process of adjudication, may give their own interpretation of the provisions in the Basic Law that are within the limits of the autonomy of the HKSAR and other provisions. This power of interpretation comes from the authorization of the NPC Standing Committee. However, if the courts of the HKSAR, in the process of adjudicating cases, need to interpret the provisions of the Basic Law concerning affairs which are the responsibility of the central government, or concerning the relationship between the central authorities and the HKSAR, and if such interpretation will affect the judgments on the cases, the courts of the HKSAR shall, before making their final judgments which are not appealable, seek an interpretation of the relevant provisions from the NPC Standing Committee through the Court of Final Appeal of the HKSAR. When the NPC Standing Committee makes an interpretation of the provisions concerned, the courts of the HKSAR, in applying those provisions, shall follow the interpretation of the NPC Standing Committee, which enjoys the same status with HKSAR laws. The fact that the Standing Committee of the NPC exercises the power of interpretation of the Basic Law in accordance with the law is aimed at maintaining the rule of law in Hong Kong, as it oversees HKSAR's implementation of the Basic Law and protects the high degree of autonomy of the region.<br><br>

We should improve the systems and mechanisms related to implementing the Basic Law, which will help enhance its authority. Since the Basic Law came into force, a series of systems and mechanisms related to its implementation have been put in place. For example, in amending the method for selection of the chief executive of the HKSAR and method for the formation of the Legislative Council of the HKSAR, a "five-step" legal procedure has been established and the five steps are: the chief executive makes a report to the NPC Standing Committee; the NPC Standing Committee makes a corresponding decision; the Legislative Council endorses the decision; and the chief executive gives his consent; and the NPC Standing Committee approves or puts it on the record. Regarding the interpretation of the Basic Law, the relevant procedures and working mechanisms that have been established include: the NPC Standing Committee interprets the Law on its own initiative; the chief executive makes a report to the State Council, which then submits it to the NPC Standing Committee and asks it to give an interpretation; or the Court of Final Appeal of the HKSAR seeks an interpretation of the relevant provisions from the NPC Standing Committee. Regarding legislation in the HKSAR, the working procedure for the NPC Standing Committee to put on the record of laws enacted by the HKSAR has been established; in terms of judicial aid between the mainland and HKSAR, arrangements have been made in mutual service of judicial documents, reciprocal recognition and enforcement of arbitration awards of civil and commercial cases as well as judgments of certain civil and commercial cases. Regarding accountability the chief executive holds to the central government, a system is in place for the chief executive to make reports to the central government on his/her own work. As the practice of "one country, two systems" continues and the Basic Law is further implemented, it is imperative to further improve the systems and mechanisms in relation to the implementation of the Basic Law. In particular, it is necessary to, with an eye to the lasting peace and order in Hong Kong, exercise well the power invested in the central government as prescribed in the Basic Law and see to it that the relationship between the central government and HKSAR is indeed brought onto a legal and institutionalized orbit.<br><br>

3. The Hong Kong People Who Govern Hong Kong Should Above All Be Patriotic<br><br>

There are lines and criteria to be observed in implementing "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong," that is what Deng Xiaoping stressed, Hong Kong must be governed by the Hong Kong people with patriots as the mainstay, as loyalty to one's country is the minimum political ethic for political figures. Under the policy of "one country, two systems," all those who administrate Hong Kong, including the chief executive, principal officials, members of the Executive Council and Legislative Council, judges of the courts at different levels and other judicial personnel, have on their shoulders the responsibility of correctly understanding and implementing the Basic Law, of safeguarding the country's sovereignty, security and development interests, and of ensuring the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. In a word, loving the country is the basic political requirement for Hong Kong's administrators. If they are not consisted of by patriots as the mainstay or they cannot be loyal to the country and the HKSAR, the practice of "one country, two systems" in the HKSAR will deviate from its right direction, making it difficult to uphold the country's sovereignty, security and development interests, and putting Hong Kong's stability and prosperity and the wellbeing of its people in serious jeopardy.<br><br>

The fact that Hong Kong must be governed by patriots is well grounded in laws. Both the Constitution and the Basic Law provide for the establishment of the HKSAR, which works for China's national unification, territorial integrity and maintaining Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. In that context, the Basic Law requires that the chief executive, principal officials, members of the Executive Council, president and over 80 percent of the members of the Legislative Council, chief justice of the Court of Final Appeal and chief judge of the High Court shall be Chinese citizens who are permanent residents of Hong Kong with no right of abode in any foreign country; that, when assuming office, the chief executive, principal officials, members of the Executive Council and Legislative Council, judges of the courts at all levels and other members of the judiciary in the HKSAR must, in accordance with the law, swear to uphold the Basic Law and swear allegiance to the HKSAR of the PRC; and that the chief executive be accountable to the central government and the HKSAR with respect to implementing the Basic Law. All this is necessary for displaying sovereignty, ensuring loyalty to the country by the mainstay of Hong Kong administrators and helping them to subject to oversight by the central government and Hong Kong society, while taking their responsibility for the country, the HKSAR and Hong Kong's residents.<br><br>

4. Firmly Supporting Chief Executive and the HKSAR Government in Governing Hong Kong in Accordance with the Law<br><br>

The chief executive, as head of both the HKSAR and its government, is the prime responsible person for implementing the policy of "one country, two systems" and the Basic Law in Hong Kong. The central government has always firmly supported the chief executive and the HKSAR government in governing Hong Kong in accordance with the law, in rallying the broad sections of the Hong Kong society for economic development, in taking effective steps to improve people's livelihood, and in advancing democracy in a gradual and orderly way to promote inclusiveness, mutual support and harmony.<br><br>

Developing the economy and improving the people's livelihood are common aspirations of the Hong Kong people. They serve as an important basis for solving social problems and ensuring overall stability in the HKSAR, and also the main task before the chief executive and the HKSAR government in governing Hong Kong in accordance with the law. At present, Hong Kong is at a critical juncture of development, with both opportunities and challenges. It should seize the opportunities and vigorously address the salient problems in its economic and social development, so as to bolster and enhance its own competitive edge, maintain a steady economic and social development, and upgrade the texture of people's life. The mainland has always been a powerful backing for Hong Kong.<br><br>

The central government continues its support for the HKSAR in developing a system of democratic governance that suits the actual conditions in Hong Kong in a gradual and orderly manner as provided for in the provisions of the Basic Law. The ultimate aim of selection of the chief executive will be one by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures and the election of all the members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage. This solemn commitment of the central government has been incorporated in the Basic Law and the relevant resolutions by the NPC Standing Committee. The central government is sincerely in favor of moving Hong Kong's democratic governance forward. The system of universal suffrage for selecting the chief executive and forming the Legislative Council must serve the country's sovereignty, security and development interests, tally with Hong Kong's actual conditions, take into consideration the interests of all social strata, give expression to the principle of equal participation, and be conducive to the development of capitalism in Hong Kong. In particular, the systems must conform to HKSAR's legal status as a local administrative region directly under the central government and accord with the Basic Law and relevant resolutions adopted by the NPC Standing Committee. Furthermore, the chief executive to be elected by universal suffrage must be a person who loves the country and Hong Kong. As long as all sectors of the Hong Kong society hold pragmatic discussions and build a consensus based on the above principles, these two ultimate goals are sure to be reached.
<br><br>
Hong Kong is a free, open and pluralistic society. It is also an international commercial metropolis where Chinese and non-Chinese cultures converge and mingle. Maintaining social harmony and stability serves the interests of all strata and all sectors of the Hong Kong society as well as those of outside investors. It is a prerequisite for retaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial, trade and shipping center. The central government will continue to encourage the people of Hong Kong to carry forward their fine traditions of inclusiveness, mutual support and respect for the rule of law and order. It calls on the Hong Kong people to seek common ground while reserving differences, be tolerant and help each other in the fundamental interests of the nation and the general and long-term interests of Hong Kong, achieve the broadest unity under the banner of loving the country and Hong Kong with strengthened social harmony and stability through compromise and mutual assistance.<br><br>

5. Continuously Promoting Exchanges and Cooperation Between the Mainland and Hong Kong<br><br>

Increasingly frequent exchanges and closer cooperation between Hong Kong and the mainland have expanded channels for common development by leveraging complementary advantages. Hong Kong has gained access to enormous space and momentum for development by taking advantage of the broad market and abundant factor resources of the mainland and opportunities of China's rapid development. By consolidating and enhancing its existing advantages, Hong Kong can better play its role in introducing external investment and talents, in absorbing internationally advanced technologies and managerial expertise, in serving as a bridge for implementing China's "go global" strategy, and in helping quicken the shift of the growth mode on the mainland. In addition, Hong Kong's experience can be of reference for the mainland to pursue innovative ways in social and economic management.<br><br>

As contacts between the mainland and the HKSAR become closer and mutual understanding between the people deepens, the Hong Kong compatriots are getting a stronger sense of national identity and commitment. They pay closer attention to the development of the country and take an active part in the country's modernization drive as well as public welfare activities, such as poverty alleviation, education and protection of the rights of women and children. When the mainland suffered major natural disasters, the Hong Kong compatriots extended generous and active support for the rescue and relief work and post-disaster reconstruction. These fully demonstrate the strong ties of blood and affection between the people on the mainland and the Hong Kong compatriots.<br><br>

The central government will continue to support the HKSAR government in forming a closer working relationship with relevant government departments at both the central and local levels, support the Hong Kong compatriots in having more exchanges with people on the mainland, and support Hong Kong in playing its unique role in the country's endeavor of comprehensive reform and opening up. The central government encourages Hong Kong to carry out broader and deeper exchanges and cooperation with the mainland, and make concerted efforts with the mainland to build the common home of the Chinese nation.
<br><br>
Conclusion
<br><br>
The implementation of the principle of "one country, two systems" in the HKSAR has achieved widely recognized success. This fully proves that "one country, two systems" is not only the best solution to the Hong Kong question left over from history but also the best institutional arrangement for the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong after its return to the motherland. Firmly advancing the cause of "one country, two systems" is the common wish of all the Chinese people, the Hong Kong compatriots included, and is in the fundamental interests of the country and people, the general and long-term interests of Hong Kong and the interests of foreign investors.<br><br>

The endeavor to further the practice of "one country, two systems" requires both a comprehensive and accurate understanding and implementation of the policy to ensure that the practice moves forward on the right track and proactive and effective response to the difficulties and challenges confronting Hong Kong in its development. In the face of profound adjustments and changes in the economic environment both within and outside the region, Hong Kong needs to continuously enhance its competitiveness. Some deep-seated problems that have built up over a long period of time are becoming more conspicuous and need to be solved by pooling the efforts of all sectors. The deepening exchanges and cooperation between the HKSAR and the mainland call for better communication and coordination, and the concerns of the people should be properly addressed. Meanwhile, it is necessary to stay alert to the attempt of outside forces to use Hong Kong to interfere in China's domestic affairs, and prevent and repel the attempt made by a very small number of people who act in collusion with outside forces to interfere with the implementation of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong. A proper handling of these issues and further implementation of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong will further demonstrate the strong vitality of the policy of "one country, two systems."<br><br>

Now, people all over the country are working hard with full confidence towards the "two centenary goals" - to complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects when the Communist Party of China celebrates its centenary in 2021, and to turn China into a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced and harmonious when the PRC marks its centenary in 2049 - as well as the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Continuously enriching and developing the practice of "one country, two systems" in the HKSAR and maintaining long-term prosperity and stability in the region are integral part of the Chinese dream. It is also a necessary requirement for improving and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governing capability. The central government will continue to work with the HKSAR government and the Hong Kong compatriots to fully and faithfully implement the principle of "one country, two systems" and the Basic Law, so as to further the development of all undertakings in Hong Kong. We are convinced that the HKSAR will advance steadily forward under the principle of "one country, two systems" and the Basic Law, and work hand in hand with the mainland toward a better future for the Chinese nation.<br><br>
