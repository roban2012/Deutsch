格但斯克（波兰语），德语称但泽（Danzig），是波兰北部沿海地区的最大城市和最重要的海港。<br><br>

最最初，中欧和东欧没有国家没有城市。但泽（Danzig）地区偶有游牧部落经过，可能是凯尔特，或者日耳曼，或者斯拉夫。按照大陆的“周口店人”逻辑，波兰人一直就生活在那里了（波兰一战后才建国）。<br><br>

但泽（Danzig）最初的居民是东斯拉夫人。997年以后，东斯拉夫人接受了罗马天主教。自从14世纪初到1945年的600多年间，但泽（Danzig）的绝大多数人口都是德意志人，德语是主要语言。在16世纪宗教改革以后，该市的居民以新教徒占绝对优势。根据1923年的人口统计数据，95%的市民是德意志人，只有3%的人口是波兰人。<br><br>

第一次世界大战德国战败。根据美国总统威尔逊要求建立波兰国。如果按照民族分布来划分国界，新成立的波兰一个内陆国家。波兰人希望得到但泽（Danzig）作为出海口。然而，但泽（Danzig）的绝大部分人口都是德国人。所以，在1919年《凡尔赛条约》中规定波兰得到通往波罗的海的但泽（Danzig），而但泽仍保持自由自治地位。但泽（Danzig）内政权归德国居民，但外交事务由波兰政府的控制。<br><br>
1939年8月27日但泽（Danzig）的日耳曼人发动骚乱。几天后，也就是1939年9月1日在纳粹入侵波兰几天。1939年9月3日，英法单方面对德国宣战（英法此举显然是意料之外的，把希特勒吓懵了）。就是但泽（Danzig）的地缘政治冲突直接导致了第二次世界大战的爆发。<br><br>

1945年，但泽（Danzig）原有的主体居民（德意志人）的25％在战争中死亡。幸存下来的德意志居民被苏联红军驱逐到奥得河以西的德国剩余领土。从此，波兰人占据但泽（Danzig）并改名格但斯克（波兰语），现在的居民绝大部分都是徒天主教。<br><br>

How the Ukraine crisis ends<br><br>

Henry A. Kissinger was secretary of state from 1973 to 1977. <br><br>
March 7, 2014<br><br>
Demonstrators with placards protest against Russian agression in the Ukraine in front of the White House on March 6, 2014 in Washington, DC. Turkey, a NATO ally, has repeatedly voiced fears about the fate of the Turkish-speaking Tatar minority in Crimea, which was part of the Ottoman Empire until it was conquered by Russia in the late 18th century. <br><br>
Public discussion on Ukraine is all about confrontation. But do we know where we are going? In my life, I have seen four wars begun with great enthusiasm and public support, all of which we did not know how to end and from three of which we withdrew unilaterally. The test of policy is how it ends, not how it begins.<br><br>
Far too often the Ukrainian issue is posed as a showdown: whether Ukraine joins the East or the West. But if Ukraine is to survive and thrive, it must not be either side’s outpost against the other ― it should function as a bridge between them.<br><br>
Russia must accept that to try to force Ukraine into a satellite status, and thereby move Russia’s borders again, would doom Moscow to repeat its history of self-fulfilling cycles of reciprocal pressures with Europe and the United States.<br><br>
The West must understand that, to Russia, Ukraine can never be just a foreign country. Russian history began in what was called Kievan-Rus. The Russian religion spread from there. Ukraine has been part of Russia for centuries, and their histories were intertwined before then. Some of the most important battles for Russian freedom, starting with the Battle of Poltava in 1709 , were fought on Ukrainian soil. The Black Sea Fleet ― Russia’s means of projecting power in the Mediterranean ― is based by long-term lease in Sevastopol, in Crimea. Even such famed dissidents as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Joseph Brodsky insisted that Ukraine was an integral part of Russian history and, indeed, of Russia.<br><br>
The European Union must recognize that its bureaucratic dilatoriness and subordination of the strategic element to domestic politics in negotiating Ukraine’s relationship to Europe contributed to turning a negotiation into a crisis. Foreign policy is the art of establishing priorities.<br><br>

The Ukrainians are the decisive element. They live in a country with a complex history and a polyglot composition. The Western part was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1939 , when Stalin and Hitler divided up the spoils. Crimea, 60 percent of whose population is Russian , became part of Ukraine only in 1954 , when Nikita Khrushchev, a Ukrainian by birth, awarded it as part of the 300th-year celebration of a Russian agreement with the Cossacks. The west is largely Catholic; the east largely Russian Orthodox. The west speaks Ukrainian; the east speaks mostly Russian. Any attempt by one wing of Ukraine to dominate the other ― as has been the pattern ― would lead eventually to civil war or break up. To treat Ukraine as part of an East-West confrontation would scuttle for decades any prospect to bring Russia and the West ― especially Russia and Europe ― into a cooperative international system.<br><br>



Ukraine has been independent for only 23 years; it had previously been under some kind of foreign rule since the 14th century. Not surprisingly, its leaders have not learned the art of compromise, even less of historical perspective. The politics of post-independence Ukraine clearly demonstrates that the root of the problem lies in efforts by Ukrainian politicians to impose their will on recalcitrant parts of the country, first by one faction, then by the other. <br><br>

That is the essence of the conflict between Viktor Yanu-kovych and his principal political rival,Yulia Tymo-shenko. They represent the two wings of Ukraine and have not been willing to share power. A wise U.S. policy toward Ukraine would seek a way for the two parts of the country to cooperate with each other. We should seek reconciliation, not the domination of a faction.<br><br>


Russia and the West, and least of all the various factions in Ukraine, have not acted on this principle. Each has made the situation worse. Russia would not be able to impose a military solution without isolating itself at a time when many of its borders are already precarious. For the West, the demonization of Vladimir Putin is not a policy; it is an alibi for the absence of one.<br><br>





Putin should come to realize that, whatever his grievances, a policy of military impositions would produce another Cold War. For its part, the United States needs to avoid treating Russia as an aberrant to be patiently taught rules of conduct established by Washington. Putin is a serious strategist ― on the premises of Russian history. Understanding U.S. values and psychology are not his strong suits. Nor has understanding Russian history and psychology been a strong point of U.S. policymakers.<br><br>
Leaders of all sides should return to examining outcomes, not compete in posturing. Here is my notion of an outcome compatible with the values and security interests of all sides:<br><br>
1. Ukraine should have the right to choose freely its economic and political associations, including with Europe.
2. Ukraine should not join NATO, a position I took seven years ago, when it last came up.<br><br>
3. Ukraine should be free to create any government compatible with the expressed will of its people. Wise Ukrainian leaders would then opt for a policy of reconciliation between the various parts of their country. Internationally, they should pursue a posture comparable to that of Finland. That nation leaves no doubt about its fierce independence and cooperates with the West in most fields but carefully avoids institutional hostility toward Russia.<br><br>
4. It is incompatible with the rules of the existing world order for Russia to annex Crimea. But it should be possible to put Crimea’s relationship to Ukraine on a less fraught basis. To that end, Russia would recognize Ukraine’s sovereignty over Crimea. Ukraine should reinforce Crimea’s autonomy in elections held in the presence of international observers. The process would include removing any ambiguities about the status of the Black Sea Fleet at Sevastopol.<br><br>
These are principles, not prescriptions. People familiar with the region will know that not all of them will be palatable to all parties. The test is not absolute satisfaction but balanced dissatisfaction. If some solution based on these or comparable elements is not achieved, the drift toward confrontation will accelerate. The time for that will come soon enough.<br><br>

It’s too easy to blame faulty decisions on imperfect information, but information is always limited in some way, as is the time available to make our decisions. Forget perfection! Decisiveness comes from the courage to trust your instincts. The more you trust, the more you’ll build up that intuition and the more accurate it will become, creating a positive cycle. Evaluation (taste/insight) is more important than calculation. Emotion is a critical element of decision-making, not a sin (Reason) always to be avoided.      <br><br>

苏联解体推手――布热津斯基

书评：苏联解体推手――布热津斯基<br><br>

英国《金融时报》 爱德华卢斯<br><br>

《兹比格涅夫布热津斯基：苏联解体之推手》《Zbig: The Man who Cracked the Kremlin》<br><br>

安杰伊卢博夫斯基(Andrzej Lubowski)著，Open Road公司出版，定价：11.99英镑<br><br>

《兹比格涅夫布热津斯基的战略思想和政治手腕》《The Strategy And Statecraft of Zbigniew Brzezinski》<br><br>

查尔斯加蒂(Charles Gati)著，约翰斯霍普金斯大学出版社(Johns Hopkins)出版，定价：29.95美元<br><br>

如今已有几十本著作论述冷战期间的美国外交大师亨利基辛格(Henry Kissinger)。而在此之前没有一本英语著作专门讲述基辛格的老对头和辩论对手――兹比格涅夫布热津斯基(Zbigniew Brzezinski)。主流观点认为，基辛格的影响比布热津斯基大，他帮助促成了中苏反目并斡旋缓和美中关系。这两本书则提出了完全不同的观点。<br><br>

这两本书一本是波兰记者兼经济学家安杰伊卢博夫斯基所著，另一本是约翰斯霍普金斯大学(Johns Hopkins University)的查尔斯加蒂编纂的。两本书提出了一个共同的观点：历史忽视了布热津斯基在预见并促成苏联倒台方面所扮演的关键角色。在加蒂编撰的讲述布热津斯基65年职业生涯的文集中，弗朗西斯福山(Francis Fukuyama)写道：“很难想象有比被实际历史事件进程证明更正确的人了。”<br><br>

将基辛格与布热津斯基比较一下，就会发现两人有着不可思议的相似之处。两人均出生于战火纷飞的欧洲：基辛格1923年出生于德国，布热津斯基1928年出生于波兰。两人均于1938年离开欧洲，踏上北美的土地。两人均是作为哈佛(Harvard)等大学的优秀学者逐步攀上权力顶峰的。两人也都保留了他们的外国口音，却成功地跻身美国白人上层社会，成为战后美国外交政策的权威人士。正如那个笑话说的那样：“美国是一个可以让兹比格涅夫布热津斯基不用改名都能名声鹊起的地方。”<br><br>

现在说说两人的不同之处。基辛格以擅长逢迎出名：他几乎总是能让对手们相信自己赞同他们的看法。以色列前总理西蒙佩雷斯(Shimon Peres)表示：“恕我直言，他是我见过的最狡猾的人。”布热津斯基则说一不二――为了更容易叫，布热津斯基经常被人称为“Zbig”。他在上世纪50年代刚出道时作为一名志向远大的苏联问题研究专家(Sovietologist)是这种性格。到了上世纪70年代末，布热津斯基成为吉米卡特(Jimmy Carter)立场强硬的国家安全顾问、负责美国的外交政策时，他仍然是个说一不二的人。无论过去还是现在，他在不同意你的观点时都会坦言告知。领教过他这种风格的包括基辛格本人――布热津斯基曾经发现基辛格“欣赏敌人而厌倦朋友”。<br><br>

或许是因为出生于波兰，布热津斯基从未怀疑过苏联的意图。他对俄罗斯民族主义几乎是出自本能的了解――他相信最近的乌克兰事件继续证明了这一点――这让他与那些专注苏联意识形态研究的学者有所不同。用以色列学者什洛莫阿维内里(Shlomo Avineri)的话来说，这种“维斯瓦河上的窗口”让布热津斯基产生了被许多人认为带有攻击性的怀疑态度，但后来的局势发展证实他的怀疑是对的。他正确地预见苏联将逐步走向解体以及其华约条约卫星国民族主义的爆发。他在卡特执政时期尽力推动这一过程。基辛格相信“权力的均衡”，而布热津斯基始终对此不以为然。正如另一个笑话所言，与苏联和平共处意味着：“我的是我的，你的我们拿来谈判”。<br><br>

事后来看，人们认为在卡特担任总统期间美国外交政策摇摆不定，而之前的理查德尼克松(Richard Nixon)是外交天才，其后的罗纳德里根(Ronald Reagan)则在外交上绝不屈服。这种看法是不公平的。卡特有着很大的影响力，这在很大程度上是因为布热津斯基。布热津斯基利用1975年的《赫尔辛基协定》(Helsinki treaty)在人权问题上刺激苏联，帮助催生了地下文学(Samizdat)以及其他异议工具。他推动美苏两国签署了《战略武器限制协议》(Strategic Arms Limitation Agreement)以削减核武器，虽然该协议最终未获批准。在苏联入侵阿富汗之后，他说动卡特为圣战者抵抗运动提供资金。在加蒂编纂的书中，大卫罗斯科普夫(David Rothkopf)写道：“卡特和布热津斯基不仅预见到了苏联的没落，而且还帮助推动了这一过程。”此外在他的斡旋下，以色列和埃及签订了历史性的《戴维营协定》(Camp David Accords)。<br><br>

他们也有过失败，最严重的要数伊朗人质危机。在1979年伊朗革命爆发数月前，卡特将伊朗王统治下的伊朗称为“稳定之岛”。布热津斯基对中东局势的理解永远赶不上他对俄罗斯的感觉。即便在今天，虽然布热津斯基或许是美国最敏锐的外交政策评论员，但他也有“盲点”。布热津斯基认为印度是一个不太可能生存下去的多种族国家，这是一种通过苏联视角看世界的后遗症。然而在20世纪末伟大的美国外交官当中，他鲜有对手。正如卢博夫斯基指出的那样，在基辛格所著的740页的《大外交》(Diplomacy)中没有一处提及布热津斯基是不公平的。
<br><br>
这两本书早就应该问世了。然而，布热津斯基值得人们再为他撰写一部翔实完整的传记。<br><br>

The Strategy And Statecraft of Zbigniew Brzezinski<br><br>
‘Zbig’, by Andrzej Lubowski; ‘The Strategy And Statecraft of Zbigniew Brzezinski’, by Charles Gati<br><br>
April 20, 2014 <br><br>

Edward LuceReview by Edward Luce<br><br>
Appreciations of Kissinger’s great rival laud the veteran’s visceral understanding of enduring Russian nationalism .<br><br>
 

Dozens of books have been written about Henry Kissinger, America’s master diplomat during the cold war. Until now, none has appeared in English about Kissinger’s great rival and sparring partner, Zbigniew Brzezinski. Conventional wisdom holds that Mr Kissinger had the greater impact, having helped bring about the Sino-Soviet split and brokered detente with China. But two appreciations present things very differently.<br><br>

History, say both books C one by Polish journalist and economist Andrzej Lubowski, the other edited by Charles Gati of Johns Hopkins University C has overlooked Mr Brzezinski’s pivotal role in foreseeing and helping bring about the downfall of the USSR. “It is hard to imagine an individual more vindicated by the actual course of historical events,” writes Francis Fukuyama in Gati’s collection of essays on Mr Brzezinski’s continuing 65-year career. <br><br>

The parallels between Mr Kissinger and Mr Brzezinski are uncanny. Both were born in strife-torn interwar Europe: Mr Kissinger in Germany in 1923; Mr Brzezinski in Poland in 1928. Both left Europe for North America in 1938. And both worked their way to the top as brilliant scholars at Harvard and beyond. Both also retained their foreign accents yet made it to the pinnacle of America’s WASPy postwar foreign policy establishment. As the joke went: “America is a place where a man called Zbigniew Brzezinski can make a name for himself without even changing it.” <br><br>

Kissinger’s ability to ingratiate 讨好 was legendary: he almost always left adversaries believing he agreed with them 
There the parallels end. Kissinger’s ability to ingratiate 讨好 was legendary: he almost always left adversaries believing he agreed with them. “With due respect to Kissinger, he is the most devious man I ever met,” said Shimon Peres, Israel’s former prime minister. On the other hand “Zbig” C as Mr Brzezinski is universally known, since it is more easily pronounced C is surgically precise in what he says. That was true in his early years as a high-flying Sovietologist in the 1950s. And equally true when he ran US foreign policy as the hawkish national security adviser to Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s. There was (and is) little doubt when he disagreed with you. Victims often included Mr Kissinger himself, in whom Mr Brzezinski once detected a “fascination with enemies and ennui with friends”. <br><br>

Perhaps because he was born Polish, Mr Brzezinski was never in doubt about Soviet Russia’s intentions. He had an almost visceral grasp of Russian nationalism C one he believes continues to be vindicated by recent events in Ukraine C differentiating him from those who focused on Soviet ideology. This “window on the Vistula”, in the words of Israeli scholar Shlomo Avineri, gave him a scepticism many saw as pugilistic but which was borne out by events. He correctly foresaw the gradual disintegration of the USSR and its Warsaw Pact satellites into their constituent nationalisms. And he did his best in the Carter years to chivvy it along. Mr Kissinger believed in the “balance of power”. Mr Brzezinski was always contemptuous of it. As another joke went, peaceful coexistence with the USSR meant: “What’s mine is mine and what’s yours is negotiable.” <br><br>
 

The Carter presidency is seen in hindsight as a period of vacillation between Richard Nixon’s genius and Ronald Reagan’s unyieldingness. That is unfair. Largely because of Mr Brzezinski, Mr Carter’s impact was dynamic. He deployed the Helsinki treaty of 1975 to needle the Soviets on human rights, helping give birth to Samizdat and other tools of dissent. He pushed a deal on the ultimately unratified Strategic Arms Limitation Agreement to reduce nuclear weapons. He encouraged Mr Carter to fund the Mujahideen resistance after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. “Carter and Brzezinski not only anticipated the decline of the Soviet Union but helped accelerate it,” writes David Rothkopf in Gati’s book. On top of that he helped broker the historic Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt. <br><br>

There were also failures, of which the Iran hostage crisis was the most spectacular. Months before the 1979 revolution, Mr Carter described the Shah’s Iran as “an island of stability”. Mr Brzezinski’s grasp of the Middle East was never close to his feel for Russia. Even today, as perhaps America’s most incisive foreign policy commentator, he has blind spots. He regards India as a multi-ethnic state unlikely to survive, a hangover from seeing the world through a Soviet prism. Yet among the great late 20th-century US diplomats, he has few peers. It is unfair, as Lubowski notes, that he merits not one mention in Kissinger’s 740-page Diplomacy.<br><br>

These two books are both long overdue. However, Mr Brzezinski still awaits the full biography he deserves.

乌克兰危机中的犹太问题<br><br>


吉赛尔斯是对的：这场危机和他们无关，这场危机和乌克兰这个刚刚起步的民族国家的生死存亡有关。
<br><br>
作者：康斯坦迪・吉伯特（Konstanty Gebert）发自华沙 来源：南风窗 日期：2014-05-01
<br><br>
“那么从犹太人的角度看呢？”我问约瑟夫・吉赛尔斯。这位乌克兰老牌持异见者、犹太活动家、乌克兰“卖当”运动的强烈支持者，刚刚向华沙群众传递了运动大获全胜、总统亚努科维奇被推翻的消息。“没有犹太人的角度，”他回答说，“分裂两边都有犹太人。”
<br><br>
他说得太对了。比如，乌克兰犹太人基金会主席亚历山大・费尔德曼就是著名的支持亚努科维奇的地区党的国会议员―尽管他在亚努科维奇被推翻后也开始谴责他。另有一些犹太寡头政治家在亚努科维奇倒台前一直和他走得很近。
<br><br>
但犹太人对反对亚努科维奇的“卖当”运动，其支持更加突出。基辅独立广场上被杀的82名反对者中有4人是犹太人，另有一个犹太“索特尼亚”组织在广场上抵抗亚努科维奇爪牙的进攻。
<br><br>
但是，在“卖当”运动中与犹太人并肩作战的乌克兰民族主义者有着长期的反犹历史。这段历史很重要，不仅因为这是犹太人带着狐疑眼光对待他们的原因。更重要的是，这支持了普京一再重复的对所谓“新纳粹、仇俄分子和反犹主义者”的指责。他指责这些“新纳粹、仇俄分子和反犹主义者”嚣张地在基辅街头肆虐，迫使本来不甚情愿的俄罗斯站出来保护犹太人、俄罗斯人和留在当地的不仇俄也不反犹的乌克兰人。<br><br>

我们对此能说些什么呢？近几周来，以犹太人为目标的暴力事件确实发生了，比如一位基辅拉比被刺身亡，扎波罗杰的一间犹太教堂也遭到了燃烧弹的袭击，但行凶者已无法查明。而“卖当”民主主义者斯沃博达党（该党有5人进入了新政府，并以战时领袖班代拉为偶像）甚至更极端的组织“右派地带”，都大力强调反犹主义不是他们现今的打算。
<br><br>
这些否认针对犹太人的行为不能只视为摆姿态。毕竟，摆姿态也要摆出你认为别人想看的姿态。而这个“别人”是“卖当”运动者，而不是《纽约时报》。如果民族主义者认为他们不会用激怒犹太人来讨好乌克兰人，那么这是值得欢迎的趋势。
<br><br>
普京认为反犹主义盛行。尽管乌克兰大拉比和犹太领袖强烈反对他的观点，但在乌克兰现代史上的确充满了令人担忧的憎恨和流血。反犹主义是欧洲20世纪民族主义的一部分，班代拉带领的乌克兰民族主义组织（OUN）也不例外。OUN在战前的波兰就组织过恐怖袭击，1941年纳粹德国入侵苏联后，OUN与纳粹勾结，以“净化”乌克兰为名屠杀了数千波兰人和犹太人。
<br><br>
但班代拉的人是没有盟友的民族主义者。OUN在纳粹拒绝乌克兰独立后便与之决裂，且与波兰共产主义和反共产主义地下运动武装都发生过斗争。在西乌克兰，他们仍是英雄史诗的化身。在俄罗斯族人口甚众的东乌克兰，他们大多被视为苏联祖国的叛徒。
<br><br>
因此，普京试图将“卖当”运动扩大化，强调OUN与纳粹的（血腥）结盟史并不令人奇怪。但他所鼓吹用于动员群众支持其乌克兰政策的“大俄罗斯”民族主义也并不更加诱人。
<br><br>
70年前，俄罗斯民族主义曾服务于斯大林的统治，它存在一个正义的目标也就是抵抗希特勒的极权主义。今天的俄罗斯与乌克兰一样，并无反犹主义的公然表现，这也是事实，因为普京对虐待犹太人十分反感，这是众所周知的。
但普京的隐含意思―他正在乌克兰重打二战，俄罗斯将再次拯救犹太人和世界于民族主义迫害者及其欧洲（或德国/纳粹）赞助人之手―我是不相信的。
<br><br>
因此，观察者应该不拘泥于过去、不忽略现在。狭隘民族主义是这场运动背后的推动力之一，因为这场运动有人所共有、亦不难理解的反俄诉求。此外，尽管这种民族主义有可能如过去一样，被引导为反对住在乌克兰的俄罗斯人、波兰人和犹太人，但“卖当”运动的其余参与者将能抵制这一转变（这也很好地解释了目前为什么没有变成这样）。
<br><br>
俄罗斯确实拥有来自各民族的说俄语的乌克兰人的支持，包括一些犹太人。但犹太活动家吉赛尔斯是对的：这场危机和他们无关，这场危机和乌克兰这个刚刚起步的民族国家的生死存亡有关。

中美就领土问题“面对面交锋”<br><br>

2014-04-09 参考消息网<br><br>

正在访华的美国国防部长哈格尔与中国国防部长常万全，4月8日在联合记者会上围绕中日东海主权争议问题展开“面对面交锋”。<br><br>

据英国广播公司网站4月8日报道，哈格尔称，中国无权单方面在未经协商的情况下宣布划设东海防空识别区。他表示，在日中发生争执之时，美国将保护盟国日本。<br><br>

常万全则指出，在涉及与邻国的岛屿主权争议问题上，北京不会首先“惹事”。但他表示，为了捍卫中国的领土主权，必要时，北京也会做好武力准备。<br><br>

常万全称领土主权问题是中美关系中“中方无法妥协的一个核心问题”。他补充说，中国愿意“与相关国家”和平地解决主权争议问题。<br><br>

哈格尔指出，华盛顿与菲日两国是签有同盟条约的盟国，“美国有尽责履行这些条约的义务”。<br><br>

美联社4月8日报道称，中美两国国防部长当天就北京的领土争议问题摊牌。美国国防部长哈格尔说，中国无权在不经协商的情况下，单方面在争议岛屿上空划设防空识别区。他还说，美国将在中日争端中保护日本。<br><br>

中国国防部长常万全说，中国不会主动挑起中日争端，但北京已经准备好，在必要的时候，以武力捍卫自己的领土。他还警告说，美国必须对日本的行为“保持警惕”，不要放纵和支持东京。<br><br>

据俄塔社4月8日报道，中国国防部长常万全8日在与美国国防部长哈格尔举行会谈时表示，中美应妥善解决分歧，加强在亚太地区的互动。<br><br>

常万全说：“双方在建立重大军事行动相互通报机制和公海海域海空军事安全行为准则两个互信机制方面进入实质性磋商阶段。”他认为，中美下一步应从相互利益出发，“消除建立友好双边关系道路上的重大障碍，解决现有分歧，加强在亚太地区的良性互动”。<br><br>

双方在会谈中还就台湾、南海、东海，以及在信息领域建立更开放合作等问题交换了意见。<br><br>

日本《外交学者》杂志网站4月8日报道称，美国防长哈格尔4月7日抵达中国，他此访将与中方讨论一系列问题，在很多问题上，美中都处在对立面。在对美中合作而言最为成熟的问题（即阻止朝鲜成为有核国家）上，双方在最佳行动方案上存在根本性分歧。中国希望推动朝鲜重返谈判（可能在六方会谈的框架下），而奥巴马政府已明确表示，在重返谈判之前，朝鲜必须采取切实的弃核行动。<br><br>

在其他问题上，美中的共同点则更少。美国高度关注中国在东海和南中国海的一举一动。从去年冬天中国宣布划设东海防空识别区，到菲律宾申请国际仲裁，美中在这些争端的发展中所采取的立场一直是对立的。<br><br>

美国务卿：俄罗斯欲重演克里米亚事件 <br><br>

2014年04月09日 <br><br>

【财新网】（记者 丁锋）乌克兰三个城市发生亲俄罗斯暴动的第四天，美方决定派出海军驱逐舰以示对乌克兰政府的支持。与此同时，美国国务卿克里（John Kerry）指责俄罗斯挑起分裂动荡，称俄罗斯可能采取与在克里米亚一样的军队行动。<br><br>

据CNN报道，出于对俄罗斯在乌克兰边界军队部署的担忧，美国海军驱逐舰“唐纳德・库克”号（USS Donald Cook）计划于周四（4月10日）前进入黑海。CNN援引两位美国军方官员的话称，该战舰将在黑海进行军演及巡港。上个月，美国导弹驱逐舰“特拉克斯顿”号（USS Truxtun）已在黑海地区参与军演，并于3月21日返回。<br><br>

根据卫星图像，美方估计目前俄罗斯部署在乌克兰边境的兵力多达4万人，驻扎极近且全副武装。CNN援引一位官员的话称，这些部队在三五天内就能穿过边境进入东乌克兰。<br><br>

此外，北约（NATO）各国代表将于4月15日举行会议，届时将讨论并可能通过采取其它军事措施的决定。比如，危机发生时，北约将缩短“反应时间”。<br><br>

乌克兰政府称，4月6日以来的占领行动是俄罗斯分裂乌克兰计划的一部分。美国国务卿克里则表示，担心莫斯科会重复在克里米亚的行动。
<br><br>
路透社援引克里的声明称，“很明显，俄罗斯特种部队及特工是过去24小时骚乱背后的催化剂，”并且，“这可能是为军事入侵制造借口，就像我们在克里米亚看到的那样。”<br><br>

早些时候，俄罗斯外交部长谢尔盖・拉夫罗夫（Sergei Lavrov）否认了西方的指责，称只有基辅将俄罗斯语地区的利益考虑在内，情况才能有所好转。<br><br>

4月6日，亲俄罗斯的抗议者在顿涅茨克（Donetsk）、卢甘斯克（Luhansk）和哈尔科夫（Kharkov）占领了政府大楼，高举俄罗斯国旗，并宣布成立新政府。<br><br>

4月8日，乌克兰军方在一次夜间行动中解除了顿涅茨克市的占领，但另外两座城市的政府大楼依然被抗议者占据着。

听普京身边的人谈普京究竟怎么想<br><br>

 
2014-04-08 <br><br> 
【本文原载于英国《卫报》，反映了西方媒体对普京的“主流”看法，以及对俄罗斯政治决策的“揣摩”，却回避了极为重要的北约东扩问题。同时，作者也习惯性地对乌克兰局势的复杂性、西方的干预和双重标准，进行了轻描淡写的处理。英国自由记者乔纳森・库克则撰文反驳作者，观察者网特翻译两篇文章，以飨读者。】<br><br>

弗拉基米尔・普京上周召集政界名流齐聚克里姆林宫圣乔治厅，宣布俄罗斯“欢迎”克里米亚“回归”。此情此景宛如俄罗斯人在欢庆打了场胜仗。<br><br>

“在大家心目中，克里米亚一直是俄罗斯不可分割的一部分。”普京说，其语气仿佛莫斯科收复克里米亚是早晚的事，“这种坚定的信念乃是基于真理与正义。”<br><br>
有人认为，后帝国主义的国际格局，以及他希望通过收复失地重塑苏联时代雄风的领袖野心，乃是普京出招的背景原因。接近克里姆林宫关于克里米亚问题的决策层的人士则认为，也许这种分析是对的，但现实更为复杂。<br><br>

最近一个月来的决策过程揭示了一系列被动、随意、冲动的欲望，而非战略意图的小心经营。<br><br>

普京认为乌克兰局势混乱，俄罗斯或将完全丧失对基辅决策层的影响力。他认为这将十分危险，会是个大麻烦。看到蒙面的革命者们大摇大摆地踩在亚努科维奇豪华官邸的地毯上，这位俄罗斯统治者可能心里不是滋味，他可是想尽一切办法扼杀本国抗议的萌芽。<br><br>

“普京憎恶革命，他是个天然的反革命分子。”一位原来与克里姆林宫过从甚密的幕僚格雷布・帕夫洛夫斯基（Gleb Pavlovsky）说，“亚努科维奇被迫出逃，俄罗斯对乌克兰的影响力彻底消失了。普京意识到，如果他再不强硬，就没人听他话了。于是他决定狠一把。”<br><br>

政治学者谢尔盖・马尔科夫（Dergei Markov）与克里姆林宫关系密切，曾经参加俄方与克里米亚当地政客的官方会谈。他说，最初的计划不是吞并克里米亚，而最终决定仅仅是两个星期前的事情。<br><br>

“决策层主要考虑两个因素。”他说，“第一，克里米亚精英的需求，他们不希望因为国际社会的袖手旁观而重蹈阿布哈兹共和国（格鲁吉亚西北一自治共和国――观察者网注）的覆辙，真诚地希望回归俄罗斯；第二，西方的立场，西方拒绝接受任何妥协。”<br><br>

马尔科夫表示，普京向西方领导人提出若干条件，他认为自己已经让步，但西方则认为这是在干预主权国家的内部事务。普京提出的条件包括，确保乌克兰临时政府包容亚努科维奇的地区党在内的各个政治力量，解除革命势力的武装，将俄罗斯语列为官方语言。<br><br>

“如果条件被接受，那克里米亚仍旧是乌克兰的一部分。”马尔科夫称。<br><br>

除了被动地对乌克兰局势做出反应，克里米亚也被看作普京长期抱怨不公正的国际秩序的一个爆发点。“他们说我们违反了国际法……至少他们还记得有国际法这样东西，这是好事，总比老是记不住要好。”普京在上周的演讲中说，“他们总是自诩独特性、例外论，以为自己可以主宰世界命运，只有他们永远正确。”<br><br>

外界从普京上周演讲中听出的意味并不新鲜，但他以前从未如此长篇大论、如此公开地蔑视现行国际秩序。“我和他的几个演讲撰稿人聊过，他们说普京亲自敲定了演讲的主要观点；这是他一贯的立场。”一位接近克里姆林宫的政治学者叶夫根尼明琴科说。<br><br>

从上述不满情绪的角度来看，俄罗斯在克里米亚的行动本质上是对西方的蛮横回击：你们老是违反国际法，那我们也要这样。<br><br>

无论是武装占领克里米亚议会，坚决否认俄军在克里米亚行动，还是以迅雷不及掩耳之势组织、干涉克里米亚公投，背后都隐藏着不可一世的心态和普京狡黠的微笑。<br><br>

“随波逐流、袖手旁观不可能干成事情。”明琴科说，“普京变得比以前更加清醒。”<br><br>

长期压抑心头的屈辱感和受害者心态让他更加憎恶西方，而这也是俄罗斯政坛的普遍情绪。索契尤其戳到了他们的痛处。2014年索契冬奥会是普京的得意工程，耗资500亿美元，但筹办过程充斥着西方抱怨同性恋权利和安全隐患等问题，几乎没几个西方政要赴会，这让克里姆林宫方面大为恼火。<br><br>

俄罗斯铁路公司总裁弗拉基米尔・亚库宁是普京的老朋友，美国制裁名单榜上有名。他说，西方就是想要“搞臭一切事情”和俄罗斯对着干，所以才批评索契冬奥会；而著名国防问题专家谢尔盖-卡拉加诺夫则抱怨关于索契的“谎言如滚雪球一般”。<br><br>





“有人说普京不在乎西方的想法；那是胡扯。”记者安东・克拉索夫斯基说。克拉索夫斯基曾担任俄罗斯寡头米哈伊尔・普罗霍罗夫2012年大选期间抗衡普京的总幕僚长，“他真的在乎，他无法理解西方为何仇恨自己，觉得很荒唐。他自认为在索契举办了一届出色的奥运会，但还是批评声不断。其中有年代和文明的因素。他希望回到能够与贝卢斯科尼把酒言欢的年代。他就是不明白为什么这么多人批评他。”
<br><br>
一些接近克里姆林宫的人士指出，普京的确对外界的批评茫然无措，他更因此而背上了“不顾及俄罗斯国家利益”的名声。大概，克里米亚的出现，让这位俄罗斯总统一打响指，决定单枪匹马上阵。<br><br>

“不管我们做什么，西方都不会支持，所以事情不会变得更加糟糕――大概是这种感觉。”明琴科说，“普京对外界十分失望，先是美国，然后是欧洲官僚。普京认为，俄罗斯已经做了太多让步，但根本没有得到承认的迹象。”<br><br>

虽然俄罗斯国会坚决支持普京的决策，但很明显，吞并克里米亚的决定是一个小圈子做出的。俄罗斯国内报纸报道，他们在政府内部的消息源都对这一决定感到意外。<br><br>

普京总统的参谋圈子正在逐渐缩小。其中大部分顾问都像总统本人一样，具有克格勃背景，能从任何事情当中看到西方的险恶用心。
<br><br>
“普京的决策过程及其反常、冲动的行为充满焦虑情绪。”上月卸任的美国驻俄大使迈克尔・麦克福尔说，“那些担心俄罗斯经济的人似乎没能参与决策过程。”<br><br>

麦克福尔是专门研究俄罗斯的学术人士，他将普京的世界观冠之以“迫害狂”的特征。他说，这位俄罗斯总统真诚地相信美国想要颠覆俄罗斯，“普京给我们俄罗斯国内外的人派了一个莫须有的机构。”<br><br>

麦克福尔称，他对近期事态发展感到十分惊讶：“我们总是从坏处考虑，但没想到事情竟会走到这一步。我总以为普京是个不喜欢国际准则的人，但至少会遵守规则、以守法为善。”<br><br>





决策虽然未经谋划，但俄罗斯精英们未必会反对。普京指定的乌克兰问题专家、经济学家谢尔盖・格拉济耶夫去年9月告诉《卫报》记者，倘若乌克兰签署与欧盟的协议，那么“政治、社会混乱”不可避免，俄罗斯可能“被迫介入”以保护乌克兰东部和南部的本国公民。乌克兰革命成功后的景象与格拉济耶夫的预言如此相似，让人不仅设想，倘若亚努科维奇成功西进，俄罗斯将会做出何种紧急反应。
<br><br>
最近几个月的局势增强了俄罗斯杜马议员们的“欧亚主义”立场。这种意识形态的态度是，俄罗斯将作为保守主义世界强国崛起，直接对抗西方的地缘政治霸权和自由主义价值观。这种意识形态主要是由亚历山大・杜金构建的。他父亲是一名克格勃官员。杜金天真地将俄罗斯通过乌克兰来左右欧洲局势的行动称之为“俄罗斯之春”。杜金是国家杜马主席谢尔盖・纳雷什金的顾问。纳雷什金是统俄党的核心人物之一，公开支持俄罗斯干涉乌克兰，并频频在电视上和政府官员一起讨论乌克兰危机。格拉济耶夫也是杜金的伙伴。
<br><br>
杜金表示，普京2012年重返总统职位，开始第三任期时，对西方的批评十分不悦，他意识到自己无法如愿以偿，独立的俄罗斯永远不可能加入“西方俱乐部”。“普京视西方为主要敌人，但这是经历种种事端之后的觉悟，他迈过了一个历史关口。”杜金说，“他从实践中得出的结论，与我们在理论上得出的结论不谋而合。”<br><br>

迄今为止，吞并克里米亚的决定在俄罗斯颇受欢迎。这从普京演讲期间不绝于耳的喝彩声便可见一斑，更不必提创下历史新高的民意支持率。但一些人怀疑这究竟能维持多久。“危机期间，我们和他们对抗的时候，人们总是会团结到本国领导人身边摇旗呐喊。”麦克福尔说，“这就是美国9・11以后的景象。民众的热情并不让人意外，宣传工作总能奏效。但相信我：来得快，去得也快。”

The Guardian: What is Putin thinking in Ukraine and Crimea?<br><br>
 March 23, 2014,  by Guardian <br><br>

When Vladimir Putin summoned the entirety of Russia's political elite to the St George's Hall of the Kremlin to announce that Russia would "welcome back" the territory of Crimea last week, the atmosphere was almost as if they were celebrating a military victory.
<br><br>
"In people's hearts and minds, Crimea has always been an inseparable part of Russia," said Putin, making it sound like it had always been a matter of time before Moscow made its move to recover the territory. "This firm conviction is based on truth and justice."<br><br>

Some have seen Putin's actions in the context of a post-imperial complex and a leader longing to reconstitute some form of the Soviet Union by gathering up lost territories. There may be a flicker of truth in this, but the reality is more complex, according to those familiar with the Kremlin's decision-making over Crimea in recent weeks.
<br><br>
The evidence about how decisions were made over the past month points to reactive, adhoc and impulsive moves rather than the implementation of a strategic gambit long in the planning.
<br><br>


Part of the issue comes from what the Russian president sees as a dangerously chaotic situation in Ukraine and Russia's complete loss of influence on the decision-making process in Kiev. The psychological element of seeing masked revolutionaries wiping their boots on the carpets at the ousted president Viktor Yanukovych's palatial compound is also likely to have had an effect on a ruler who has done everything to ensure that protest stirrings at home are nipped in the bud.<br><br>

"Putin hates revolution, he's a counter-revolutionary by nature," says Gleb Pavlovsky, a former Kremlin-linked spin doctor. "Yanukovich was forced to flee, and the Russian system of influence on Ukraine ended. Putin realised that no one would listen to Russia if he didn't strengthen his position. So he strengthened it."
<br><br>
According to Sergei Markov, a Kremlin-linked analyst who has been taking part in official meetings with local politicians in Crimea, the initial plan was not to annex Crimea, and the final call to do so was taken only a fortnight ago.
<br><br>
"There are two major factors that played a role in the decision," he says. "The first was the demands of the Crimean elite, who did not want to end up like Abkhazia in international limbo and really pushed strongly to be part of Russia, and the second was the position of the west, who did not want to listen to any compromise."
<br><br>
Markov says Putin laid down several conditions to western leaders which he saw as a compromise solution but they viewed as unwarranted meddling in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. The conditions included ensuring that Ukraine's interim government involved a coalition of all political forces, including Yanukovych's Party of Regions, disbanding all armed revolutionary factions and making Russian an official state language.
<br><br>
"If this had happened, Crimea would still be part of Ukraine," says Markov.
<br><br>
As well as merely reacting to events in Ukraine, there was also a sense that the Crimea situation is a culmination of many years of grievances with what Putin sees as an unfair international system. "They say we are violating norms of international law … It's a good thing that they at least remember that there exists such a thing as international law C better late than never," said Putinlast week, to an ovation from the hall. "They have come to believe in their exclusivity and exceptionalism, that they can decide the destinies of the world, that only they can ever be right."
<br><br>
What the world heard from Putin last week was not new in its thrust, but never has he spoken at such length and with such open contempt for the current international order. "I talked with his speechwriters and they said that he himself dictated the main points of the speech; it's his own deeply held position," says Yevgeny Minchenko, a political analyst close to the Kremlin.<br><br>

Viewed through the spectrum of this discontent, Russia's actions in Crimea are essentially a petulant riposte to the west: we think you break international law all the time, so we will too.
<br><br>
The armed seizure of the Crimean parliament, the cynical insistence that Russian troops were not operating in Crimea when they clearly were, and the breakneck speed and flagrant violations involved in organising the Crimean referendum at short notice have been hidden behind a thread of plausible deniability stretched infinitesimally thin C and a knowing smirk on Putin's face.<br><br>

"To keep the gloves on while everyone else allows themselves everything is not pragmatic," says Minchenko. "Putin has become more realistic."<br><br>


<a href= "pic206.html">Harry Potter 核心情节</a><br><br>

<a href= "pic08.html">文摘（战争和航海）</a><br><br>


Feeding into this irritation is also a deep-seated sense of injustice and unfair victimisation from the west that has long been a feature of Russian political thinking. Sochi is a particular sore point. The 2014 Winter Olympics was Putin's pet project, costing $50bn , yet the build-up was permeated with noise about gay rights and security concerns from the west, and few heads of state visited the games, to the irritation of the Kremlin.
<br><br>
The Russian Railways boss, Vladimir Yakunin, a close associate of Putin's and now placed on the US sanctions list, said the west wanted "to befoul everything" to do with Russia and thus criticised the Sochi games; while the influential defence analyst Sergei Karaganov complained about an "avalanche of lies" about Russia over Sochi.
<br><br>
"People say that Putin doesn't care what the west thinks; that's nonsense," says Anton Krasovsky, a journalist who was chief of staff for the oligarch Mikhail Prokhorov when he ran against Putin in the 2012 presidential elections. "He does care, and he doesn't understand the hatred towards him from the west, which he feels has no basis. In Sochi, he organised what he saw as an incredible Olympics and people still criticised him for it. It's partly a generational and civilisational thing. He wishes he could go back to the era when he could just drink wine and have fun with Berlusconi. He just doesn't understand why people criticise him so much."
<br><br>
A number of those close to the Kremlin point to this genuine feeling of bewilderment about criticism and what is seen as an unwillingness to take Russia's interests into account. Over Crimea, it seems, the Russian president simply snapped, and decided it was time to act unilaterally.
<br><br>
"The feeling was that whatever we do, the west won't support it, so things can't get any worse," says Minchenko. "Putin was seriously disappointed with the attitude toward the Russian regime, first of all from US, but also from the European bureaucracy. Putin thought that Russia had taken too many steps toward compromise, but there weren't even any hints of acknowledgment."<br><br>

<a href= "pic57.html">挑战原文：但泽（Danzig）</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic208.html">美国领导世界</a><br><br>

Despite the staunch support for the move in Russia's parliament, it is clear the decision to seize Crimea was taken by a very small circle of people. Russian newspapers reported that all their government sources had been taken completely by surprise by the move.<br><br>

The president now takes counsel from an ever-shrinking coterie of trusted aides. Most of them have a KGB background like the president and see nefarious western plots everywhere.
<br><br>
"There is a tremendous anxiety about Putin's decision-making and the erratic, impulsive behaviour," says Michael McFaul, who was US ambassador to Russia until last month. "Those that worry about the economy in Russia do not appear to be part of the decision-making process."<br><br>

McFaul, a professional academic who works on Russia, describes Putin's worldview as "paranoid". The Russian president genuinely believes that the US is attempting to destabilise Russia, he says: "Putin assigns us all kinds of agency in Russia and across the world that we simply don't have."
<br><br>


McFaul says he has been surprised by recent events: "We always thought of worst-case scenarios, but I did not expect it to go this far. I always thought of Putin as someone who doesn't like international norms, but operates within them and thinks that Russia is best off operating within them."<br><br>

That the decision-making was adhoc does not mean it did not tap into aspirations that have long been bottled up among sections of the Russian elite. Putin's Ukraine point-man, the economist Sergei Glazyev, told the Guardian as long ago as September that if Ukraine were to sign the integration agreement with the EU, "political and social chaos" would ensue and Russia could be "forced to intervene" to protect Russians in the east and south. What happened after the successful revolution is so close to what Glazyev predicted might happen if Yanukovych had taken Ukraine westbound that it is tempting to think a contingency plan for a different scenario was taken off the shelf and activated.
<br><br>
The events of recent months have also solidified the hold of "Eurasianism" on the imaginations of Russia's top lawmakers. This ideology envisions Russia's re-emergence as a conservative world power in direct opposition to the geopolitical hegemony and liberal values of the west. The ideology was largely developed by Alexander Dugin, the son of a KGB officer who has become the wide-eyed prophet predicting a "Russian spring", as he called his recent plan for Russia's domination of Europe via Ukraine. Dugin serves as an adviser to State Duma speaker Sergei Naryshkin, a key member of the ruling United Russia party who has loudly supported Russian intervention in Ukraine, and has made widely viewed television appearances to discuss the Ukraine crisis alongside high-ranking members of the government. Glazyev is also an associate of Dugin's.
<br><br>
Upset with western criticism of him when he returned to the presidency for a third term in 2012, Putin realised that an independent Russia could never be part of the "western club" as he had previously wanted, says Dugin. "Putin sees the west as his main enemy, but to come to this conclusion he lived through a lot, he lived through a historical situation," Dugin said. "He came to the same conclusion in practice as we did in theory."
<br><br>
So far, the decision to seize Crimea has gone down well in Russia, evidenced by the seemingly endless ovations for Putin during his speech, and by his record-high approval ratings among the public. But some wonder just how sustainable this is. "In times of crisis, in times of us versus them, people always rally around their leaders and their flag," says McFaul. "That's what we saw after September 11 in the US. The fervour doesn't surprise me, and the propaganda works. But believe me: this stuff goes away pretty fast."
