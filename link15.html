日本《外交学者》2014年1月25日文章，原题：中日新冷战　近来，似乎日本官员打喷嚏都会惹恼中国人―反之亦然。所以也难怪，日本首相的和解性讲话遭中方断然拒绝。<br><br>

目前而言，安倍做什么都不能令北京满意(除非就参拜靖国神社及日本帝国主义的过去道歉，但这是不可能的)。在中国官员看来，安倍“自相矛盾”。与此同时，从日方的观点来看，若安倍将剩下的任期用来证明与中国的友谊，那显然不利于日本的利益。<br><br>

所以，我们如今看到的是，两个国家都在扩军，同时坚称必须这样做才能对付地区对手的威胁。中日对彼此的政治高度不信任，加上历史上结怨，这造成两国互相猜疑很重。两国都宣称爱和平，同时又用恐吓策略，试图把对方描绘成顽固妖魔。这一切是不是似曾相识？<br><br>

战略家们一再提醒领导人丢弃“冷战思维”。显然无济于事，因为这恰恰是中日关系目前的状况。两国视彼此为对手，任何一方的言行都会引起对方反击。两国关系紧张会在令人意想不到的地方冒出，如在安倍访问非洲时，在瑞士的全球经济峰会上。<br><br>

经贸关系密切并未对阻止紧张起到帮助。相反，紧张削弱了中日经贸关系。民调显示，60%的中国企业主如今不愿与日本公司合作。日本商界也开始转而关注其他地区。<br><br>

同冷战一样，问题一定程度上在于，中日均有意将对方的一举一动解读为挑战或威胁。中美之间存在种种不信任，但还没到中日这般地步。美国有太多的敌人和全球利益，中国不可能将其每一个外交或战略动作都解读为反华。同时，北京如今将扩军和战略目标限于近海，这种情况下，东京很容易将中国的每一个举动都解读为针对日本。<br><br>

China and Japan’s war of the words reveals a larger struggle for regional influence akin to a mini Cold War.<br><br>
 By Shannon Tiezzi<br><br>
January 25, 2014<br><br>

Lately, it seems that Japanese officials can’t sneeze without incurring the wrath of the Chinese ― and vice versa. So it’s no surprise that even conciliatory statements from Shinzo Abe have been soundly rebuffed. On Thursday, Abe wrote a message, published in local Chinese-language papers, conveying greetings for the lunar new year. According to Reuters’ translation of the Japanese-language version, Abe insisted that Japan has “taken the path of peace” since World War II, and “nothing has been changed in the policy of continuing to uphold this position.”<br><br>

Friday, Abe further extended the olive branch. According to Channel NewsAsia, Abe told a parliamentary session that “Japan and China are inseparable.” He also expressed his desire for the two countries to restart diplomatic meetings. “Instead of refusing to hold dialogue unless issues become resolved, we should hold talks because we have issues,” Abe said.<br><br>

China flatly rejected these overtures. Responding to earlier requests for a bilateral dialogue, Qin Gang responded with bitter sarcasm: “Such kind of dialogue will be of no effect. Chinese leaders are very busy. Let them spend more time on things useful and effective.” China has repeatedly expressed its position that no diplomatic meetings between China and Japan can be held until Shinzo Abe proves his sincerity. During Friday’s press conference, Qin Gang laid down a specific path for restarting dialogue: Abe should declare that “I will pull back from the precipice, immediately admit and correct mistakes and make no more visits to the Yasukuni Shrine.”<br><br>

As I wrote earlier, at this point it seems impossible that anything Abe will do will satisfy Chinese leaders (the things he could do, like apologizing for his visit to Yasukuni and/or Japan’s imperialistic past, are incredibly unlikely). To Chinese officials, Abe is “self-contradictory,” as an editorial in China Daily put it. Unless Abe apologizes for and refrains from repeating actions that upset China (from visiting Yasukuni to building up Japan’s military), China will dismiss as insincere his rhetoric about dialogue and peace. Meanwhile, from the Japanese perspective, were Abe to devote the rest of his administration to proving his friendship to China, it would have obvious negative repercussions for Japanese interests.<br><br>

So we have two countries, each building up their militaries while insisting they must do so to counter the threat of their regional rival. Added to this, a deep distrust of each other’s different political systems coupled with a history of animosity makes the two nations deeply suspicious of each other. Each country insists it loves peace, and uses scare tactics to try to paint its opponent as a hawkish boogeyman. Sound familiar to anyone else?<br><br>

Ever since the Cold War ended, strategists have been warning leaders to drop the “Cold War mentality.” But it apparently hasn’t worked, because that is exactly what we have right now between China and Japan. The two countries identify so strongly as rivals that it’s impossible for either country to do or say anything without triggering a response from its counterpart. The tensions pop up in the most unexpected places C during Abe’s Africa tour, during a global economic summit in Switzerland.<br><br>

Even the strong economic ties between China and Japan haven’t helped forestall tensions. In fact, it’s the other way around C tensions are eroding the economic relationship. The Telegraph recently reported that, according to a poll, 60 percent of Chinese business leaders are unwilling to work with Japanese firms. In 2012, China-Japan tensions even erupted into outright calls to boycott Japanese products, with rioters targeting Japanese businesses and restaurants. While Japan’s business view of China is less affected (according to The Telegraph, 80 percent of Japanese are willing to continue trade with China and South Korea), economic interests are shifting to other regions, notably Southeast Asia. Economic ties are likely to continue worsening. It’s certainly hard to see the next round of negotiations on a trilateral China-Japan-South Korea free-trade agreement going off as planned in February 2014.<br><br>

As with the Cold War, part of the problem is that both China and Japan willfully read each other’s every move as a challenge or threat. For all the distrust between China and the United States, the problem hasn’t reached this level (yet). The U.S. has too many potential enemies (Russia, Iran, North Korea) and too many global interests for China to realistically interpret every diplomatic or strategic maneuver as somehow anti-China (although certainly some hawks within China do try). Japan, with its more limited global presence and strategic interests, is a different story. Meanwhile, as China is currently limiting its military build-up and strategic goals to the near seas, it’s easy for Tokyo interpret each move (for example, a new air defense identification zone) as directly aimed at Japan.<br><br>

<a href= "pic61.html">Das gibt's nur einmal</a><br><br>

My colleague Zachary wrote Friday that one byproduct of the United States’ decline could be the emergence of regional hegemons. We might be seeing the beginning of this process now, with China and Japan in a Cold War-style battle, not for global power but for regional dominance. The territorial dispute highlights this by increasing the possibility of military conflict, but even if the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands were to sink into the ocean tomorrow (one possible benefit of global warming) the tensions would remain. It’s a regional Cold War, currently being fought with words but with an arms race looming on the horizon. And, like the Cold War, tensions are unlikely to end until one country claims victory.<br><br>

The Geopolitics of the Black Sea<br><br>

America has the Caribbean, China has the South China Sea, and Russia has the Black Sea.
<br><br>
By James R. Holmes<br><br>
April 16, 2014
<br><br>
Still think an incidents-at-sea (INCSEA) agreement between China and the United States is some sort of cure-all for high-seas disputes between the two seafaring states? At most it would be a palliative. Heck, after the news out of the Black Sea this week, I’d settle for an INCSEA agreement between the United States and Russia. Here’s some proposed language:<br><br>

Commanders of aircraft of the Parties shall use the greatest caution and prudence in approaching aircraft and ships of the other Party operating on and over the high seas, in particular, ships engaged in launching or landing aircraft, and in the interest of mutual safety shall not permit: simulated attacks by the simulated use of weapons against aircraft and ships, or performance of various aerobatics over ships, or dropping various objects near them in such a manner as to be hazardous to ships or to constitute a hazard to navigation.
<br><br>
Whoops. My bust. That’s the text of Article IV of the INCSEA accord concluded by Washington and Moscow … 42 years ago. The accord remains in force to this day despite the fall of the Soviet Union.
<br><br>
Yet words on parchment did little to stop a Russian Su-24 Fencer attack plane from making repeated passes near the destroyer USS Donald Cook in the Black Sea last Saturday. The encounter spanned 90 minutes, meaning this was no fighter jock out hotdogging. This was a deliberate provocation. INCSEA agreements are fine for averting escalation during genuine misunderstandings. Warlike acts are another matter entirely.
<br><br>
But why such conduct now? It appears something about enclosed and semi-enclosed seas encourages the local great power, or powers, to think about them in proprietary terms. Ringed by strong sea powers, the Mediterranean Sea was an arena of nautical strife from classical antiquity until well into living memory. The United States had the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. China has the South China Sea and East China Sea. And Russia, it seems, has the Black Sea (and covets primacy in an ice-free Arctic Ocean ― but that’s a story for another day).
<br><br>
Roughly speaking, there are two paradigms, the American and the Chinese. In the age of the Monroe Doctrine, the United States saw itself as the rightful warden of American seas. It forbade new colonial ventures during the nineteenth century, briefly claimed its “fiat” was “law” in these expanses in the 1890s, and ultimately settled on an “international police power” designed to foreclose European acquisitions of Caribbean naval bases. It was meddlesome and at times abusive toward Latin American republics. One thing Washington never did, however, was assert title to the waters and islands of the Gulf and Caribbean. Nor did it claim to set the terms by which foreign shipping navigated Western Hemisphere seas.
<br><br>
Which is the Chinese model. Cordoning off most of the South China Sea and declaring it a zone of “indisputable sovereignty” sounds suspiciously as though Beijing considers these waters internal waters, subject to domestic law. So we have open- and closed-sea variants of great-power primacy in semi-enclosed seas. Which paradigm fits Russia most closely? Or is the Russian model something different entirely? It could be. Black Sea geography differs from the Mediterranean, Caribbean, and China seas in that a foreign power, Turkey, bestrides the single gateway to the waters. The prospect of being cut off from the Mediterranean, and thence from the Atlantic Ocean and Red Sea, could modify how Moscow sees this maritime preserve.
<br><br>
The geopolitics of the Black Sea basin, then, is worth exploring, and comparing to the geopolitics of other confined seas. These days INCSEA isn’t much of an indicator of Russian behavior. Divining Moscow’s attitudes toward its surroundings might supply a yardstick.

安倍不可能就拜鬼及帝国主义行径向中国道歉<br><br>
2014-01-26  环球时报<br><br>

《日本经济新闻》2014年4月16日发表题为《与一战前不吉的相似性》的文章，作者为日本京都大学教授中西宽。
<br><br>
2014年逐渐作为一个转折年份被历史长河铭记。在一战爆发100周年，同时也是柏林墙倒塌25周年的今年，世界局势迎来冷战结束以来最剑拔弩张的局面。<br><br>

不言自明，直接起因是欧美与俄罗斯围绕乌克兰局势产生对立。俄罗斯普京政权闪电吞并克里米亚引起欧美强烈反弹。欧美近来持续加强对决俄罗斯的姿态，包括促使联合国大会通过认定吞并无效的决议、北约决定向东欧成员国增派军事力量等。
<br><br>
一些人宣称“冷战已死灰复燃”，但在当今世界，各国之间的相互依存关系要比冷战时代深厚得多，完全不是一个数量级。这是好事，也是坏事。<br><br>

最佳方案是“和平解决方案”，即各国领导人注意到对立造成的损失，不采取单方面行动，通过以谈判解决争端这种手段达成共识。最糟糕结局是对立不只停留于“冷战层面”，而是陷入“热战”，就是陷入“一战”那样的事态。届时可能造成比一战还要惨烈的灾难，因为一战时还没有核武器。<br><br>

东西方“新冷战”或“第二次冷战”是一种介于最佳方案和最糟糕结局之间的折中局面，因为冷战时代最受青睐的核遏制力理论将可能起作用，但出现折中局面的概率在三种可能性中是最低的。
<br><br>
话虽如此，在21世纪，真的可能上演大国战争等事态吗？就在数个月前，无人认为这会带有几分现实意味。时至今日，世界上大部分人仍不相信大国之间会打仗，但不容忽视的一点是，眼下的局面和一战开战前的状况呈现出不吉的相似性。
<br><br>
在近年出版的一战相关著作中，引起英语地区热议的是英国剑桥大学教授克里斯托弗・克拉克撰写的《梦游者》。该书认为，当时的欧洲各国领导人像梦游者一样不知自己正在走向何方，最终导致一战爆发。
<br><br>
事实上，当今世界也和一战前一样，前景极度不明朗。在去年的叙利亚化武危机中，在到底是谁动用了化武这一问题不明确的情况下，各方就销毁叙化武达成协议，但叙内战并无平息的迹象。
<br><br>
另一方面，主要国家领导人对彼此的不信任感正在加剧。日中没有举行领导人会谈，美俄领导人之间也只剩冰冷的感情。本应为友邦的日韩也几乎没有对话，还有美国高官被曝曾痛骂欧盟。在浓雾中，各国领导人虚张声势，认为自己的不安情绪不会被对方察觉，犹如在上演一场“懦夫游戏”。这种姿态看上去就像梦游者。
<br><br>
总的说来，乌克兰已经陷入看不到希望的境地，欧美与俄罗斯在没有提出任何解决方案的情况下，正在让局势进一步升级。当然，普京政权吞并克里米亚不仅违反国际法，而且其排外的民族主义已经显现出危险的征兆，因此我们也可以理解美国前国务卿希拉里・克林顿为什么会将这种做法与希特勒相提并论。
<br><br>
但是，假设这一比喻成立，西方是不是应该为避免重蹈二战前绥靖主义的覆辙而尽早与俄罗斯对决？正如当年不知能否遏制希特勒一样，今天我们也不知道能不能遏制得了俄罗斯。
<br><br>
为今之计，乌克兰民众、欧美以及俄罗斯应当同时对今日乌克兰的局势进行反省，联手找到打破僵局的办法。乌克兰问题已经成为当今世界的共同课题，为什么这样说？因为如果解决不了，不仅是乌克兰，世界任何地方都有可能爆发冲突。
<br><br>
具有军事和经济脆弱性的日本不得不与西方保持联系，想在欧美和俄罗斯之间坐收渔利的外交风险过高。但同时，日本在同欧美、俄罗斯抑或是中国打交道时，也要从梦游症中回过神来，平静地表达理性解决问题的必要性。当然，为了达到这一目标，必须以我们自己采取理性行动为前提。<br><br>

Drop the Double Standard on Japanese Defense<br><br>


Can Abe’s ambitions really be viewed as a return of prewar Japanese militarism?<br><br>

By Aurelia George Mulgan<br><br>

June 03, 2014<br><br>
Japan is currently in the midst of a domestic political debate about whether or not it can participate in collective defense with the United States. This raises the question whether the time might be right for the international community to drop the double standard that it applies to the military roles and capabilities of the Japanese defense forces (SDF).<br><br>

This double standard derives from Japan’s war history and holds that Japan presents a perennial risk of revived militaristic nationalism. It therefore judges Japan’s military activities much more critically than those of other neighboring states. It mistakenly assumes that a militarily more powerful Japan must necessarily become a threat to the rest of Asia rather than a stabilizing influence, and that Japan, even in the midst of provocative actions by other states, particularly China, must refrain from any new military commitments.<br><br>

Japan has followed a slow, incremental and politically fraught path to defense normalization spanning decades. Both the Japanese people and the international community have demanded a high standard of justification for even the most modest addition to the functions of the Japanese military, even when these additional roles have not involved the use of force, such as providing logistical support for UN peacekeeping operations and rear area support for U.S. forces under the defense cooperation guidelines.<br><br>

The constitutional and legal strictures under which the Japanese defense forces operate continue to impose some of the tightest rules and regulations on any military in the world. First and foremost, what the SDF are permitted to do and where must conform to the long-standing interpretation of Article 9 (Peace Clause) of the Japanese Constitution. Second, and by no means less importantly, what the SDF can do is strictly controlled by legislation. If laws, including the SDF Law, do not authorize a particular function, then it is proscribed. The legal basis for SDF action means that the domestic political requirements for major changes in Japanese defense policy are that new proposals be incorporated into legislation and formally approved by a majority in the Diet. These democratic processes of lawmaking have, in the past, helped to ensure that despite the desires of some Japanese leaders to push the boundaries of SDF action, changes have been limited to piecemeal advances.<br><br>

The question now is whether, how and to what extent due political process will circumscribe the ambitions of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to expand the roles of the Japanese military forces, including authorization of a collective defense role. The convoluted and extended discussion currently being conducted in Japan on this question illustrates once again the tortuous political process that each step towards Japan’s defense normalization must take.<br><br>

The formal-legal requirements of defense policy change sit alongside an additional, compelling political constraint C the need for support from the so-called “national defense consensus.” Inevitably, proposals for change elicit strong opposition from sections of the general public and media, and from political groups, including political parties, stemming from an entrenched “culture of antimilitarism.”<br><br>

Not surprisingly, politically entrenched pacifist elements in Japanese society and politics have surfaced to hold the Abe administration to account. Objections to the Japanese military forces participating in collective defense are even being raised openly by senior members of Abe’s own government. The path forward will not be smooth.<br><br>

In this context, it is important to maintain the distinction between militarism and expanded military roles and capabilities. They are not the same thing. Prewar Japanese militarism was built into the very ethos of the state. The 1934 “Basic Principles of Japanese Defense and Proposal for Defense Buildup” declared that “war is the father of creation and the mother of culture.”<br><br>

Postwar, militarism has been excised from state ethos and replaced with the peace ethos of Article 9. Perhaps this explains why Japanese pacifists hold the spirit of the Constitution so close to their hearts. They bear in mind the maxim of former Foreign Minister Zentaro Kosaka who said in 1970, “Militarism is a ghost that we must always watch closely.” The Japanese people watch this ghost closely and so continue to distrust military and political leaders who are historical revisionists such as Shinzo Abe. They accuse the prime minister of wanting to attack the Constitution in order to “shake free of the postwar regime.” In their view, because Abe sees the Constitution as a symbol of the postwar order that was imposed by the occupation forces, he regards it as in need of amendment in order for the Japanese people to regain pride. In this way, Abe has put himself on the “watch” list.<br><br>

The argument about Abe’s unhidden agenda to change the constitution may have a point. What is qualitatively different about the current plan for Japan to assume a collective defense role is that it proposes to dump a long-standing (since 1981) interpretation of Article 9, which permits the Japanese military to act only to defend Japan in the event that it is attacked directly and to use the minimum necessary level of military force to do so C the absolutely fundamental principle of “exclusively defensive defense” that is deemed compatible with Article 9 and which permits Japan to maintain military forces. This makes the debate about Japan’s assuming a collective defense role significantly more consequential compared with previous additions to SDF roles, which did not challenge this fundamental principle to anything like the same degree.
<br><br>
What is more, the major change in interpretation would be made by the cabinet rather than through any processes involving the Diet or the voters, which places the Constitution itself under possible future threat of revision by reinterpretation rather than by undergoing the formal (and politically difficult) amendment procedure. Abe and his clique of historical revisionists, including Minister of Education Hakubun Shimomura, National Public Safety Commission Chairman Keiji Furuya, and Minister of State for Regulatory Reform Tomomi Inada, could use the change in constitutional interpretation not only as a precedent but also as a stepping-stone to achieving formal amendment of the Constitution itself. Abe has justified his advocacy of collective defense by saying that “under the current Constitution, we can’t participate in combat outside the country, and so it [the Constitution] cannot protect the people’s lives.” In other words, exclusively defensive defense is no longer sufficient to protect Japan. Superficially this is a powerful argument, but it does not stand up to close scrutiny. Participating in combat “outside the country” does not necessarily enhance Japan’s ability to defend itself. In fact, it may endanger Japan’s security further by drawing it into a conflict that it might otherwise have avoided.
<br><br>
On the other hand, while Abe and others who support his goals have certainly been assertive in their ambitions to shake off Japan’s historical legacy, there is a world of difference between what they are proposing and Japan’s prewar military expansionism. The government must observe due political process and remains politically accountable to a population that is steadfastly cautious and anti-militarist, and would never countenance military action that was anything more than legitimate self-defense in the face of an increasingly dangerous regional environment.
<br><br>
It is also important to separate Abe’s personal motives from a dispassionate and objective assessment of what Japan needs to do in order to deal with new kinds of security threat. The collective defense proposals include others that affect areas where Japan’s own ability to defend itself is debatable. The question remains whether Japan has the capability to deal with “grey zone” threats to remote islands in the Southwest, which fall between the cracks of permissible SDF and Japan Coast Guard functions.
<br><br>
As a gesture to solidify the alliance with the United States, Japanese participation in collective defense is also important. Indeed, the political value of collective defense to Japan may outweigh its security value in an alliance context. It is designed to elicit a stronger U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan, particularly to the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea. It is ironic that a potentially significant development in the U.S.-Japan alliance relationship is occurring at a time when the current American and Japanese administration basically don’t like each other. In particular, figures close to the prime minister view the Obama administration coldly and, to some extent, the feeling is mutual. The White House is wary of the Abe administration because of America’s vested interest in regional stability and the record of extreme Chinese reactions to Abe’s symbolic gestures of historical revisionism (by, for example, visiting the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo) as well as Japanese unwillingness to acknowledge a sovereignty dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu.

Why Are China's Neighbors So Afraid of Her?<br><br>


Chinese people need to reflect on why their words and actions are so frightening to other countries.

<br><br>

Yang Hengjun<br><br>
 

May 23, 2014<br><br>
The anti-China riots in Vietnam left at least one Chinese dead and hundreds injured. Local Chinese have been afraid to speak Chinese in Vietnam. <br><br>

Countries with the same system and ideology are not definitely going to be China’s friends. Russia in the north and Vietnam in the south were once “comrades and brothers,” but they have also been historically unfriendly towards China, which is something to keep in mind…<br><br>

In fact, it is almost impossible for China to be a hegemon in the international arena. China’s values and philosophy are not convincing to or admired by others, and China has few real allies. Plus, China is beset by a lot of domestic problems. Forget hegemony―though it seems powerful, China is much weaker than it seems, like a giant with feet of clay. However, the impression we have given to the international community is that China is a “tyrant,” and many neighboring countries are beginning to fear and hate China. Over the years, in my travels in China and abroad, I’ve experienced this deeply.
<br><br>
The United States claims it is “rebalancing to Asia,” but it’s been slow to act on this. Why? Because it doesn’t have to―America is waiting for its opportunity! It is waiting for China to mess things up for itself. When China’s relations with neighboring countries have deteriorated one by one, when the Asian countries are beginning to “fear” China, then even if America didn’t want to “rebalance to Asia” the other countries would ask it to return. We should think about this: In a few short years, many Asian countries have come to believe that China is more “hegemonistic” and more frightening than the U.S. We can really escape all responsibility for this? 
<br><br>
The injustice is, China hasn’t done anything wrong! And our leaders endlessly “justify” China’s action. But there’s one area where we are guilty. Look at public opinion in China: from netizens to the Foreign Ministry, everyone’s busy talking about defending the Diaoyu Islands, teaching the Philippines a lesson, putting little Vietnam in its place, or joining with Russia to fight the United States. When it comes to diplomacy and China’s relations with her neighbors, everyone is amped up. But after years of talking, what do we have to show for it? Outside of smashing some Japanese cars (which were made in China, and driven by Chinese people on Chinese soil), not only have we not recovered a single inch of territory, but we’ve made the U.S. and Japan move closer to each other. Japan is arming itself, a few poor souls have been caught by the Philippines and threatened with a prison sentence, and now, violent groups in Vietnam are openly killing Chinese people! How is that right?
<br><br>
The last time I went to a TV station to film an international program, I asked a friend why they always dragged out Mr. So-and-so to talk about China’s foreign relations. Not only does he not understand the situation, I said, but he’s full of hatred and violence, totally against the spirit of China’s diplomacy and foreign policy. If I were a foreigner and watched his program, I would think that China is a fascist country, not just a simple hegemon. My friend at the station told me this guy’s show gets high rating. The viewers love it! Moreover, he said, I’ve noticed that if people lean left rather than right on foreign affairs, then even if you’re wrong the authorities won’t be offended. Whereas if we have you on the show, Mr. Yang, what you talk about will be “sensitive”―even if the Foreign Ministry announces the same policy tomorrow.
<br><br>
So let’s imagine for a bit: what if America (which is more powerful than China) had a TV show sponsored by the government where the speakers constantly talked about “sending troops” and “teaching China a lesson.” What would happen? The professor who taught me international relations once said that international relations are like the relationships between people. If you do not understand something, put yourself in the other person’s shoes and think about it. Then you’ll understand.
<br><br>
Some of us just do not understand. According to their thinking, once China becomes strong we can recover the disputed territory by force, and wipe clean our “shame.” But in fact, the territorial disputes didn’t start yesterday, although they have really flared up in the past few years. There are many complex historical reasons for the disputes. Of course, in our opinion, the problem is that the United States doesn’t want China to be strong, so it gets China’s smaller neighbors to stir up trouble to contain China’s rise. But to people in many other countries, it’s the exact opposite: China is strong and is preparing to change the status quo by force―China is going to bully those smaller, weaker countries.
<br><br>
Of course, this isn’t true. But there’s one thing we can’t deny: many of the government-controlled media outlets have clearly revealed that kind of thinking. It seems right to us: if we cannot recover China’s territory, then why do we have an army? Why did China become strong? But people in other countries will naturally be worried, and they will prepare to join together and even urge America to “rebalance to Asia.”
<br><br>
We have a clear “Cold War mentality”: When a small country fights with us or causes trouble, then it is secretly supported by the United States. It’s as if China is the only country on earth that is really independent, unafraid to stand up even to stronger countries. No, we assume that other countries have to find a patron before they can fight with us. How big of a “tyrant” do you have to be to force small countries to cling to the U.S. for support before daring to argue with you? In fact, in modern international relations it’s difficult to use big guns as your only source of support. “A just cause enjoys abundant support while an unjust cause finds little support”― this is the slogan we proposed and we should remember it. China has never been afraid of being bullied by strong countries and in fact has been bullied by other countries in the past. But our smaller neighbors are the same way.
<br><br>
Let’s return to the question: The violence in Vietnam was horrifying, and we cannot help but think of the sad history of anti-China sentiment in Vietnam. We cannot let the thugs escape the law, and Vietnam must provide compensation for all the economic losses. Vietnam must also accept responsibility for the casualties. Vietnam must punish the rioters and promise to China that no similar incidents will occur in the future.
<br><br>
However, as a rising power, we should also take some time to reflect. President Xi said, “There’s no gene for invasion in the Chinese people’s blood.” China does not seek hegemony; this has been emphasized many times. But our official media as well as social media do appear to have the “gene” for verbal abuse, if not hegemony. The media should align itself with the speech of President Xi, instead of adding fuel to the fire on international issues just for the sake higher ratings and more clicks. In addition, when stressing the relations between big powers (like Europe, Russia, and the United States), we should not forget the most important thing: improving our relations with neighboring countries. As President Xi said, “A far-off relative is not as good as a close neighbor.” China should make greater efforts to keep good relations with its neighbors, putting aside prejudice and historical baggage, in order to gradually adapt to its role as a big country.

<a href= "pic209.html">“优等民族”考</a><br><br>

美国并非凡事都是第一<br><br>

我们这些美国人从小就自夸我们是世上最强大的国家，最富有的国家，最自由和最幸福的国家。严格来讲，挪威人均财富比我们多，日本人寿命比我们长，这没错，但全世界都在看NBA，为凯蒂・佩里所倾倒，用iPhone在Facebook上发帖，在我们的航空母舰之前颤栗，把一切罪责推给中情局。我们是第一！<br><br>
 在某些方面，我们的确是无可非议的第一，但在一项新近得出的132个国家宜居程度的重要排名中，美国第16位的排名是发人深省的。如此平庸的表现是因为，我们没能把经济和军事优势转化为普通国民的福祉。<br><br>
 在社会进步指数（Social Progress Index，简称SPI）排名中，美国在获取高等教育方面表现优异，但在其他方面表现平平。甚至连获取手机和互联网方面，美国的排名都是令人失望的第23位，这跟五分之一的美国人缺乏互联网接入有一定关系。“一个拥有硅谷的国家，信息获取渠道匮乏方面却亮红灯了，真是不可思议。”本次排名的负责人迈克尔・格林说。美国在对无人机的投资上的表现，要比对下一代的投资强，而对社会服务的削减可能会进一步加剧社会矛盾。<br><br>
 在本次SPI排名中，新西兰名列第一，紧随其后的是瑞士、冰岛和荷兰。在某种程度上，它们的人均财富都少于美国，但似乎更擅长满足其国民所需。<br><br>
SPI为哈佛大学知名商学教授迈克尔・E・波特的发明，他说，他越来越意识到，社会因素对经济增长的支撑：税收政策和法规会影响经济前景，但教育、医疗和社会包容度一样可以。这个指数是以巨量的数据作为基础的，反映了自杀、物权、学生出勤率、对移民和少数族裔的态度、女性的机会、宗教自由、营养水平、电气化等等方面。<br><br>
 爱尔兰人在19世纪纷纷逃往美国寻找机会，如今这个国家排在第15位，比美国的排名要高一位。加拿大排在第七，是G7国家中排在最靠前的，此外德国在第12，英国在第13，日本第14。倒数第一给了乍得。<br><br>
 相比之下，有些国家却得到了超出自身实力的成绩。哥斯达黎加的表现，比一些富裕得多的国家要好，菲律宾、爱沙尼亚和牙买加也是。在非洲，马拉维、加纳和利比里亚最抢眼。孟加拉国（第99）比更富有的印度（第102）靠前。同样地，乌克兰（第62）比俄罗斯（第80）强。中国排名第90位，低于邻国蒙古国（第89）。中国在基础教育方面成绩不错，但在信息获取等领域表现落后。<br><br>
 一切都取决于我们想成为一个什么样的国家，我们是不是对GDP这个衡量指标给予了过分的信赖。总体来看，从1975年到2006年，美国经济的表现要优于法国。但在那段时间里，法国99%的人口分享到的增长，其实要多于美国99%的人口。除去顶部的1%，法国国民平均下来日子要比美国人过得好。这种繁荣和机遇分享上的欠缺，遏制了我们的社会进步。<br><br>
 解决这个问题非一夕之功，但基础教育和医疗保障显然可以作为入手点。就增加机遇或提升社会服务进行的讨论，通常围绕着社会正义和公平展开。社会进步指数提醒我们，这些议题同样事关这个社会的健康―还有我们在全球的竞争力。<br><br>

 宋鲁郑：还没放下乌克兰，美国又瞄向中国？<br><br>

2014-04-14 <br><br>

2014年最令人关注的全球地缘政治事件就是乌克兰危机。俄罗斯和西方也瞬间从过去的“友好”演变成激烈的对抗。一般都认为，置身事外的中国是这场危机的最大得利者。甚至认为将如同二十一世纪初的“9 11”一样，这次事件改变了美国的对外战略，为中国赢得新的发展历史机遇。<br><br>

然而，令人“意外”的是，美国一方面持续和俄罗斯过招，另一方面却屡屡剑指中国：3月30日，在中菲仁爱岛争端问题上，美国公开支持菲律宾的军舰补给，国务院发表声明重申支持通过和平方式解决海洋争端，相关国家不用担心遭到打击报复，包括恐吓和胁迫。
<br><br>
4月1日，美国负责亚太事务的助理国务卿拉塞尔在国会听证时，把中国力压朝鲜作为美国从中国周边减少驻军的交换条件。他还声称，克里米亚模式可能成为中国在南海通过武力或胁迫手段获取领土的先例，东南亚国家对此感到担忧。中方不应误判美协防盟友的决心，应承诺和平解决领土争议。
<br><br>
4月5日，美国副总统拜登会见香港反对派时称，美国将持续支持香港的民主和高度自治。
6日，美防长哈格尔在与日本防相小野寺五典及安倍首相举行的会谈中，一再强调美方认为钓鱼岛在日本的实效控制下，是日美安保条约第五条的适用范围。美国反对任何以力量对抗改变现状的做法，将履行承诺，协助日本抵御任何的军事侵略，保护日本的安全。双方还表示，要共同牵制中国。
<br><br>
7日，美国联邦众议院通过“确认《与台湾关系法》重要性和向台转让海军舰只”议案，再度要求奥巴马政府对台出售四艘护卫舰。又一次违反中美在冷战时达成的“八一七公报”。
<br><br>
事情到了这一步，美国似乎认为还不够，还把剑锋指到经济领域：4月7日，美国财政部称，美国正密切关注中国政府对汇率政策的立场，若近期的人民币贬值暗示了中国将背离向市场汇率机制转变，将引发“严重关切”。又把操纵汇率的帽子抛向中国。就是摩根士丹利前首席经济学家、耶鲁大学全球事务研究所高级研究员斯蒂芬 罗奇都公开认为美国财政部警告中国进入操纵汇率的新阶段是完全错误的（其另一句话则是：美国存在着自己的问题，它不能拿自己的问题再责怪中国）。
<br><br>
应该说，中美在上述领域的冲突和博弈过去一直都存在。只是世人无法理解的是，何以乌克兰危机不但没有令美国的立场软化相反更是密集地出手？
<br><br>
最有可能的原因是，美国把中国当作头号竞争对手和遏制目标的战略并没有因为乌克兰危机而动摇，相反更为加强。
<br><br>
上世纪九十年代，美国一直在遏制和接触政策中摇摆，一方面是中国韬光养晦，另一方面国际上流行的（也是海内外自由派强力鼓吹的）“中国崩溃论”对美国决策者还是具有较大的影响。但进入二十一世纪后，中国的蓬勃发展终于令美国醒悟。只是针对中国的战略刚刚确立，便发生了“9 11”。由于这是美国独立战争后，第一次本土遭到袭击，而且是经济和军事的象征――纽约世贸中心和五角大楼，顿时令一触即爆、牛仔性格的美国人来了一百八十度大转弯，结果送给中国一个非常难得的长达十年的战略机遇期。有了这次教训，乌克兰危机便无法起到当年“9 11”的“成效”。
<br><br>
要想理解美国的战略坚定性，必须要明白中美之间究竟存在何种不可化解的矛盾。
<br><br>
从宏观上讲，西方之所以崛起后统治世界，并不是依靠它的所谓普世价值，而是三样硬实力：资本的垄断权、工业技术及产品的垄断权、原材料的定价权。没有了这三样，西方在世界上就无法维持现有的地位。而中国仅仅用了三十五年，就大有取代之势。
<br><br>
中国是全球第一大外汇储备国，对外贷款总量超过世界银行。仅2013年，中国对外投资就超过900亿美元，对俄罗斯、美国、澳大利亚、欧盟的投资分别实现685%、232.2%、109.3%、89.9%的高速增长。中国对外投资的存量2003年仅有330亿美元，2011年就达到了4247.8亿美元，辐射全球177个国家和地区，其中对发展中国家的存量占89%。完全打破了西方过去在全球的垄断性地位。
<br><br>
另外，2012年中国成为全球制造业第一大国，使美国一百多年来第一次失去这顶骄人的桂冠。目前在工业制成品中，中国已经有超过130种产品的产量世界第一。和西方比起来，中国不仅效率高，而且价格更具竞争力。2014年2月19日，美国国会竟出现这样罕见的一幕：国会议员迈克 汤普森提出议案，要求国防部采购的国旗百分之百是“美国制造”。因为他发现美军士兵们带着国旗进行战斗，在境外基地中升起美国国旗，怀着胜利的喜悦在队伍中高举国旗，但令人讽刺的是这些星条旗往往是在中国制造的。当然，如果说国旗只和士气与荣誉有关的话，那么美国B-1轰炸机和F-16、F-35战斗机中也违反美国法律使用中国造的原材料和配件，则真真切切地让美国感到了威胁。
<br><br>
至于全球原材料价格的波动，则和正在进行人类史上最大规模工业化的中国密切相关。中国经济的晴雨表已成为决定全球原材料价格最主要的因素。
<br><br>
应该说，站在西方的立场上，中国的崛起确实是威胁。对于广大的第三世界国家来说，当然是难得的机遇。
<br><br>
<a href= "link14.html">舆论战、心理战、法律战</a><br><br>

中美之间除了普遍性还有特殊性。这就是双方存在的结构性矛盾：美国不甘心失去全球老大的地位，而中国也不会仅仅满足于世界老二的位置。全球货币地位也只有一家。这是零和游戏，不会有双赢。
和过去美国取代英国不同，中国的制度和西方完全迥异，中国的成功在世界上意味着政治制度层面还有另外一种选择。然而，政治制度就怕有可替代性。当年封闭自成体系的苏联对西方的最大威胁就在于它提供了另外一种制度发展模式。
<br><br>
我们不妨想想，西方之所以没有在2008年号称百年一遇的经济危机中倒掉，不就是依赖于它们在政治制度模式上的霸权地位吗？美国之所以能挺到现在，还不是因为它同时拥有美元全球货币地位吗？假如失去这一切，当下一场危机来临时，西方还凭什么度过危机？
<br><br>
世人常讲，中国的崛起是二十世纪下半叶以来最重要的地缘政治事件。现在这个地缘效应通过乌克兰危机得到了强烈的显现。众所周知，苏联解体后，不管是叶利钦还是普京执政，西方从未放弃过一切打压的机会。但和叶利钦的逆来顺受不同，普京是强硬以对。这一次更是令西方颜面扫地。普京之所以能够如此，除了经济恢复和能源武器之外，根本的还是中国崛起。西方任何反制措施都由于中国的存在而失去了意义。对于西方而言，乌克兰危机并没有令它们感到俄罗斯多么可怕，而是实实在在感受到了中国的力量。这就是为什么前文认为，乌克兰危机反而更加强化了美国针对中国的战略。
<br><br>
如果这种分析是正确的，那么乌克兰将成为俄罗斯和西方博弈的牺牲品。毕竟从西方的角度看，俄罗斯别说吞并克里米亚，就是吞掉整个乌克兰，其实力也没有挑战和取代西方的可能性。现在的乌克兰，失去克里米亚之后局势仍然未能稳定。东部亲俄城市又开始上演克里米亚的戏码：民众上街、占领政府机关、宣布独立、提出加入俄罗斯的公投。虽然面对乌克兰和西方的指责，俄罗斯均否认这些活动是它指使的。但假如俄罗斯识破西方目前的战略，吞并克里米亚后再染指乌克兰东部地区是再正常不过的。因为它知道，西方的头号对手是中国，而不是自己，西方也不会为了乌克兰再犯“9-11”时的错误。这对俄罗斯来说实在是天赐良机。
<br><br>
当然，美国此时对中国不软反硬还有一种可能性，即担心中国借乌克兰危机出现的历史机遇，也向西方发难。比如中日钓鱼岛之争、中菲越的南海之争。甚至人民币突然持续贬值也有可能认为是中国借助西方聚焦乌克兰乱局而刻意为之。所以为了避免两线做战，美国便以进为退，采取预防性措施。这就是为什么负责亚太事务的助理国务卿拉塞尔提出，中国会用克里米亚模式处理在亚洲的领土争端。
<br><br>
美国的“反常”还有一种解读，即美国不满中国在乌克兰问题上的中立，借上述问题敲打中国。假如中国在未来继续不合作，美国还是有办法给中国颜色看看。
<br><br>
不管美国是出于何种目的，面对它的挑衅中国还是要十分谨慎地应对。因为美国想要达到或者客观上会产生的效果有二：一是给中国制造麻烦，让中国穷于应付，减缓中国崛起的势头。二是美国的挑衅会引发中国民意的反弹。假如中国政府处理不好，将导致国际问题国内化。进而影响到中国的稳定和发展。
<br><br>
对于中国而言，最重要的一点是，此时和美国摊牌不符合中国的利益。中国一方面要有分寸地反击，另一方面还是要静观其变。因为美国国内外都面临着许多挑战，随时都会引爆。比如美国国会今天就要举行中期选举，两党将围绕奥巴马的医疗法案再次斗得你死我活。2013年双方就曾为此导致联邦政府关门大吉。更何况选举年，选民重视的是国内问题，比如就业、失业保险和财政问题（7000亿财政赤字，18万亿债务），奥巴马的精力也会转向国内，无法分心与中俄缠斗不休。
<br><br>
另外，除了俄罗斯抓住机遇对乌克兰步步进逼――染指东部、提高天然气价格、逼迫乌克兰还债务，令西方休战不得之外，阿富汗、伊拉克、叙利亚、巴以谈判、埃及大选都是一个个定时炸弹。而这些也都不是美国能够坐视不管的。所以，以本人预测，这一波风浪过后，中美又会平静下来。不是美国想如此，而是实在是形势比人强。只是有一点，中国对俄罗斯的支持还要更猛烈一些，继续让普京乘胜追击吧。或许乌克兰被西方抛弃的命运，会令哪些被美国利用的小国醒悟过来，去务实地面对中国。
<br><br>
最后要说的是，美国面临俄罗斯肆无忌惮的挑战，宁可在全球失掉面子也不改变中国是头号竞争对手的战略，也从另一个方面印证了中国模式的成功以及美国对中国制度模式未来发展的判断――至少自由派唱衰和否定中国制度模式的观点和理论没有被美国所接受。美国的立场，已成为中国“三个自信”最好、最有力的外部支撑和证明。本来，美国的制度软实力对中国还是有一定压力的，只是这样一来，反而（一定程度地）被自我化解。

China, War, and the 'Sentiments of a Nation'<br><br>


Clausewitz’s writings on the sentimental dimensions of war help explain China’s recent moves in the South China Sea.
<br><br>
By Kerry Brown<br><br>

May 28, 2014<br><br>
The nature of warfare has changed radically since the time almost two centuries ago when Carl von Clausewitz wrote On War,  his great treatise on the subject. For him, the great exemplars of tactical genius were Napoleon and von Bulow; the horrors of absolute, mechanical war lay in the future. Even so, there is one great insight in von Clausewitz’s work which has resonance across the ages and transcends culture. “We are apt to regard the combat in theory as an abstract trial of strength, without any participation of the feelings,” he writes, “and that is one of the thousand errors which theorists commit.” Clausewitz acknowledges that “the heart and sentiments of a nation” are an enormous factor in the product of its political and military strength.  Of all the noble feelings that fill in the human heart in the exciting tumult of battle, he writes, “none, we must admit, are so powerful and constant as the soul’s thirst for honor and renown.” War as a battle of feeling and moral sentiment rather than brute strength is his great message. And it helps us today when we look at different kinds of conflict across the world.<br><br>

Anyone looking dispassionately at China’s pushback with Vietnam in the last month without Clausewitz’s insight might profess puzzlement. It seems illogical. Firstly, China has serious domestic security issues at the moment, with a number of very nasty attacks related to Xinjiang over the last few months. Secondly, China has a number of ongoing territorial spats, with those involving Japan and the Philippines being the most severe.  Thirdly, relations even with the DPRK look bad, with rumors that the Chinese have been exerting pressure on the capricious young leader of their northeastern neighbor not to go ahead with another nuclear test.  With all this negative activity happening inside and outside, why do more to alienate regional neighbours, and the international community, by encroaching symbolically onto contested territory and raising the hackles of a famously bellicose neighbor to such an extent that Chinese investments in Vietnam are attacked and people have to be repatriated?  Far from promoting China’s self-interest, isn’t this damaging them?
<br><br>
Were foreign policy a solely rational process, where cause and effect follow smoothly along, then we might try to divine some long-term strategic intent from Beijing to make sense of its recent moves. But it is probably wiser to take heed of Clausewitz’s writing on the sentimental and moral dimensions of war. China is a country that has become wealthy and (through that wealth) powerful relatively quickly. It has done this largely under the skeptical and often ill-disposed eyes of the rest of the world, who dislike its political system. Its demise has been predicted many times in the last two decades, more often than not through wishful thinking. Despite all the challenges, China has so far prevailed. It is not surprising therefore that it now feels some right in flexing its muscles, and pushing back.
<br><br>
Add to this the weight of memory. Events 75 years ago sometimes seem like yesterday in the Chinese psyche. Young people might not know much of the detail of the war period from 1932 onwards, but going by the cacophony on Chinese social media they have certainly acquired anger and feeling about that time. Chinese leaders might have problems creating unity over internal social policy, but all the evidence points to the fact that when they put pictures of their troops and agents undertaking operations like the recent ones in the South China Seas, the public is on their side, and a sunny unity reigns across the country. Which leader wouldn’t want to exploit this at a time when so many other issues are contentious and tough?<br><br>

Dabbling with public sentiment about your country’s historic resentments and frustrations at how little heed is paid to its international pride and status is one thing. But it takes leaders of what Clausewitz called profound moral and intellectual skills to be able to channel this in the right direction, rather than being pushed along by public opinion towards an unexpected clash that might not work in their favor. Emotion and public sentiment are powerful allies in even a phony conflict.<br><br>

But should any strategist in Beijing be tempted to dabble with a real military clash along the maritime borders, then they need once more to have a look at the great German theorist. He writes of the crucial need, in a zone of human activity so prey to fortune and chance, to have a military that is “habituated” C trained in the real theatre of war, and used to its experiences, rather than theory. And here the Vietnamese link is a sobering one. The last time Chinese forces had any significant combat experience was in 1979, with the Vietnamese. It ended up being a debacle. This profound awareness of a real lack of experience means that, for all the noise and threats, only in the most exceptional circumstances would Chinese leaders really push the button for conflict. And that, for all of us, inside and outside China, is a very good thing.

列强的赌注：一战与小国

巴尔干导火索<br><br>

1389年6月15日（儒略历），奥斯曼军队与试图阻拦他们的基督教联军在科索沃平原展开决战。塞尔维亚的贵族精英几乎全部在战场上阵亡，七年之后塞尔维亚被奥斯曼帝国吞并。科索沃的灾难给后世的塞尔维亚人留下深刻的印象。1817年近代塞尔维亚复国后，每年都要在儒略历6月15日（公历6月28日）纪念科索沃战役。由于这一天也是基督教圣徒维图斯的主日，因此在塞尔维亚也被称为“维多夫丹节”。
<br><br>
与信奉东正教的塞尔维亚人相反，波斯尼亚的居民大多数属于异端的鲍格米尔教派，这个教派认为物质世界是撒旦而非上帝创造的，因此世人必须抵制物质诱惑，过禁欲生活。奥斯曼帝国征服波斯尼亚后，大部分鲍格米尔教徒皈依了伊斯兰教。在土耳其人统治时期，波斯尼亚实际上相当于一个自治的贵族共和国，当地总督多是本地贵族，虽然保持了自己的语言，但在衣着、头衔和生活习惯上仿效土耳其人。
<br><br>
1877年俄土战争结束后，奥匈帝国以“代管”的名义出兵占领了波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那，理由是统治该地的土耳其政府颟顸无能，导致骚动迭起。但是，奥匈帝国在1878年的《柏林条约》中允诺，“一旦波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那恢复秩序与繁荣”，就把两省归还给土耳其。在不到二十年的时间里，奥匈当局改善了当地的教育、卫生、土地和宗教事务，修筑了公路、铁路和桥梁。另一方面，随着公路、铁路和学校的普及，加速了塞尔维亚民族主义在波斯尼亚人中的散布和传播。
<br><br>
在十九世纪末的欧洲，民族主义成为支配性的政治力量，而且常常与所谓“伟大的帝国主义视野”联系起来。在强盛的欧洲大国中，民族主义与帝国主义往往宿命地、不可分离地联系在一起，并且互相促进。坚定的民族主义者也是帝国主义事业的支持者。由于投入和期望很高，帝国主义目标的不断挫折往往加强民族主义，并使其变得更具有侵略性和扩张性。这方面最明显的例子就是奥匈帝国。1866年奥地利在普奥战争中战败后，德国首相俾斯麦就一直积极鼓励它向巴尔干地区“发展”。英国为了遏制俄国南下进入地中海，一边扶植摇摇欲坠的奥斯曼帝国，一边也默许奥匈帝国在巴尔干地区的势力扩张。
<br><br>
另一方面，法国同塞尔维亚、罗马尼亚等国有密切的文化和经济联系。罗马尼亚人视法国为“拉丁文化之母”，二十世纪初的布加勒斯特被誉为“东欧的巴黎”；塞尔维亚军队的武器主要从法国进口。这样，法国在巴尔干地区同奥匈帝国形成了竞争关系。
<br><br>
与此同时，俄国也长期视信奉东正教的巴尔干地区为自己的势力范围，并在1877年俄土战争之后使得罗马尼亚和保加利亚脱离了奥斯曼帝国版图。俄国的长远目标是吞并这两个国家，以及奥斯曼帝国其余的欧洲领土，将君士坦丁堡变为“沙皇格勒”，并获得自由进出黑海的咽喉要道。但是俄国的南下一方面受阻于英国的“大博弈”，另一方面也受到奥匈帝国的阻挠。
<br><br>
1903年塞尔维亚军官团发动政变，推翻了声名狼藉的奥布拉诺维奇王朝，卡拉乔治维奇王朝国王彼得一世登基。他采取较为开明的政策，恢复宪法，财政也纳入了轨道。外交方面，塞尔维亚向俄国靠拢，并设法改善同邻国保加利亚的关系，甚至提议两国实行关税同盟。这将损害奥匈帝国的利益。
<br><br>
1905年，奥匈帝国要求塞尔维亚终止和保加利亚的关税同盟谈判，并且要求塞军的全部军火都从奥匈帝国订购。这两个要求遭到拒绝后，奥匈宣布对塞尔维亚过境运输的商品征收巨额关税。塞尔维亚的出口商品中有百分之九十是运往奥匈，或通过奥匈运往海外的，其中生猪又占了其中很大一部分，因此这场关税战被称为“猪战”。
<br><br>
塞尔维亚人虽然处境困难，但拒不让步。他们与奥斯曼帝国达成安排，使用萨洛尼卡港出口货物，同时还在西欧找到了新的市场。“猪战”不止促使塞尔维亚人认识到他们急迫需要一个出海口，更加深了他们对奥地利的怨恨。“不扩张便灭亡”成了塞尔维亚激进分子的口号。有些人主张吞并马其顿和萨洛尼卡地区，还有人希望吞并波斯尼亚、黑塞哥维那和黑山。
<br><br>
1908年，奥斯曼帝国开始实施“青年土耳其党”改革，这令奥匈帝国忧心忡忡，唯恐对方以“国内政治已日趋完善”为由索回波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那。当年10月6日，奥匈总督布里安男爵突然宣布将这两个省并入奥匈帝国。此举既未与其他大国协商，也违背了1878年奥匈帝国在《柏林条约》中的承诺。塞尔维亚群情激愤，举国沸腾，认为奥匈吞并波斯尼亚是故意针对塞尔维亚的挑衅举动。
<br><br>
布里安男爵的举动差点使欧洲在1908年就陷入一场大战。英国和法国自不用说，连德国也对此举十分气恼，可是德国又不能同它这唯一坚定的盟国发生争吵。俄国的反应最接近于战争。在几个月的时间里，塞尔维亚报纸连篇累牍地鼓吹对奥匈帝国宣战，并盼望俄国的支援。但是由于德国向俄国施加压力，警告说会动员兵力帮助奥匈帝国，俄国人只好打退堂鼓。1909年3月，俄国外交大臣萨松诺夫通知塞尔维亚政府，“我国军队尚未准备妥当，现在无法作战。”塞尔维亚被迫接受既成事实。
<br><br>
奥匈帝国吞并波斯尼亚之后，许多反对哈布斯堡王朝的塞尔维亚秘密会社迅速崛起，其中之一名叫“不统一毋宁死”（Ujedinjenje ili Smrt），又叫“黑手会”（Crna ruka）。其成员囊括了最激进的塞尔维亚民族主义者，他们主张吞并波斯尼亚、黑塞哥维那、克罗地亚、斯洛文尼亚等南斯拉夫人居住的地区，由塞尔维亚人当统治民族。
<br><br>
1914年6月，奥匈帝国陆军在波斯尼亚境内举行年度野战演习。弗朗茨 约瑟夫皇帝指派皇储弗朗茨 斐迪南大公作为奥匈陆军军事总监出席这次演习。波斯尼亚-黑塞哥维那总督奥斯卡 波提沃雷克还邀请大公出席萨拉热窝博物馆的开馆仪式。这些日程安排在当年年初便公布于众了。<br><br>

斐迪南大公的妻子是波希米亚贵族，常年居住在波希米亚和斯洛伐克地区。斐迪南对奥匈帝国境内的斯拉夫人怀有同情，倾向于给他们更多的自治权利。他曾经研究过把奥匈二元帝国改组为一个由日耳曼人、匈牙利人和斯拉夫人组成的三元帝国。斐迪南周围的斯拉夫学者小圈子在1906年提出了一个方案，把奥匈帝国变成一个类似瑞士的联邦制国家，即“大奥地利合众国”， 设想把奥匈帝国按照种族和语言分布划分成十五个联邦州，各州都有其主体民族以及相应的宪法，联邦政府只管辖外交、国防、财政，以及海关、铁路和邮政等全国性事务。
<br><br>
塞尔维亚民族主义者认为斐迪南大公的计划会给他们的“大塞尔维亚”事业带来巨大的威胁。如果斐迪南继承奥匈皇位、并实现这些计划，将解决奥匈帝国境内的斯拉夫民族政治危机，使其更加忠诚于哈布斯堡王朝，并给要求吞并波斯尼亚和克罗地亚的塞尔维亚沙文主义者带来巨大的政治障碍。正是因为这一原因，“黑手会”从1914年5月起就开始策划暗杀斐迪南大公。
<br><br>
1914年6月28日，即“维多夫丹节”这一天，斐迪南大公和妻子乘火车从军事演习地附近的伊利扎温泉抵达萨拉热窝，旋即被“黑手会”下属组织“波斯尼亚青年党”的刺客加夫里若 普林西普刺杀。这是引爆“巴尔干火药桶”的最后一颗火星。仅仅三十三天之后，欧洲的五个大国和两个小国便在从比利时到东普鲁士的欧洲大陆上打得不可开交了。
<br><br>
巨兽虎口之间
<br><br>
在德国总参谋部第一次世界大战爆发前所制订的战略计划中，比利时和卢森堡是一个决定性的因素。在二十世纪开头十年中，德国总参谋长施利芬伯爵制订了一个计划：首先蹂躏这两个国家的中立，继而展开广泛的扫荡，完全击败法国。最后利用德国发达的铁路网把全部陆军力量运往东线，指向俄国。
<br><br>
1715年以前卢森堡是哈布斯堡王室的领地，大革命期间被法国吞并。在1815年的维也纳和会上，经过一系列复杂的领土交换，奥地利把卢森堡转让给荷兰，荷兰统治者奥兰治-拿骚家族把在德意志地区的四块领地转让给普鲁士，普鲁士放弃吞并萨克森王国的要求。1830年，由于政治权利、语言、宗教等问题上的分歧，尼德兰王国（荷兰）南方的九个天主教省份爆发起义，但是卢森堡城始终掌握在荷兰手里。1839年英、法、俄、奥、普五国与荷兰在伦敦签署条约，比利时解散其与荷兰的联盟，成为一个永久中立的国家，英国、奥地利、法国、普鲁士和俄国成为其中立的保证国。卢森堡的西半部并入比利时，东半部“作为一个独立的大公国”交给荷兰，荷兰国王兼任卢森堡大公。
<br><br>
1866年法国皇帝拿破仑三世试图吞并卢森堡，作为法国在普奥战争中保持中立的报酬。荷兰国王威廉三世也同意以五百万盾的价格把卢森堡卖给法国，但是普鲁士首相俾斯麦把拿破仑三世的领土要求秘密通知给了英国，从而使得法国陷入孤立。与此同时普鲁士当局也通知法国，吞并卢森堡意味着两国绝交。正在俾斯麦部署总动员的时候，列强迫使他接受在伦敦召开的国际会议的调解。当年召开的伦敦会议规定卢森堡在列强的共同保证之下，成为一个享有完全独立和被解除武装的永久中立国家。1890年荷兰国王威廉三世去世后，由于没有男性继承人，按照拿骚家族两个分支在1783年的一项协议，拿骚公爵阿道夫公爵成为卢森堡大公。
<br><br>
根据毛奇的计划，在战争爆发时，德国将在中路部署四十万人，取道卢森堡和阿登山区入侵法国，右翼七十万人则取道比利时，“让其末梢袖拂海峡”。德军将在第十二日攻占比利时的列日要塞，第十九日占领布鲁塞尔，第二十二日进入法国境内，第三十九日占领巴黎。至于列强在两个国际条约中加以保证的比利时和卢森堡的中立问题，毛奇在1913年曾经说：“我们必须抛弃关于侵略责任问题的一切世俗看法……只要胜利就师出有名。”
<br><br>
<a href= "pic70.html">一生中只追求完美</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic100.html">爱（Was du liebst, lass frei）</a><br><br>

1914年8月2日星期日，德国符滕堡亲王阿尔布雷希特指挥的第四集团军越过边界，侵入了完全没有武装的卢森堡大公国。卢森堡政府所能设置的唯一象征性的障碍物，是横置在宫堡桥头上的一辆大公府的汽车。从8月30日到9月28日，德皇威廉二世把他的大本营设在了卢森堡。
<br><br>
风暴继而转向西面，冲向了比利时。此时比利时已经宣布动员，但由于伦敦条约所规定的中立义务，以及对继续维持中立的信心，其总参谋部仍然没能制订有效的防御计划。比利时军队将领秉承十九世纪的法国军事操典，信奉“进攻至上”的原则，主张把军队集中部署在边界，放弃一切防御纵深，根本不顾这种教条对比利时这种国土狭小的中立国来说是不现实的。
<br><br>

8月2日晚上八点，德国驻比利时公使递交了一份蛮横的最后通牒，声称有迹象表明法国正在比利时南部集结军队，显然是要“经过比利时国境进犯德国”。通牒要求允许德国军队穿过比利时领土，并对比利时实行“保护性占领”。如果比利时反对，将被视作敌国，它与德国的关系将“听凭枪炮来决定”。在当天的比利时国务会议上，国王阿尔伯特说：“不论后果如何，我们的回答必须是‘不’。我们的责任是捍卫我们的领土完整，对此我们必须坚定不移。”
<br><br>
8月3日凌晨一点三十分，坐立不安的德国公使乘坐汽车来到比利时外交部，试图打听那份最后通牒的效果。几年来德国总参谋部一直用这样的想法来安慰自己，就是比利时不会反抗。但现在事到临头，德国人开始对比利时人的反应感到焦虑不安了。如果比利时反抗，那么将对德国总参谋部精密安排的进军时间表带来严重的影响。
<br><br>
半夜两点三十分，在王宫召开的比利时国务会议作出决定：拒绝德国的最后通牒。比利时政府认为，如果接受德国的要求，比利时将“牺牲其民族尊严，背叛其对欧洲的义务”。比利时政府还宣布“坚决以其权力范围以内的一切手段抵抗侵犯”。天亮之后，比利时政府把自己的答复通知给德国，并且下令炸毁横跨马斯河的大桥，以及与卢森堡交界处的桥梁和隧道。8月3日早上八点过二分，第一波德国部队冲过了比利时边境，比利时宪兵从哨所里开了火。
<br><br>

8月4日，德国首相贝特曼 霍尔维格在柏林国会大厦发表讲话，吞吞吐吐地承认入侵比利时和卢森堡是违背国际法的，是“我们现在正在犯的过错”。但是当天傍晚，在英国大使向德国递交立即撤出比利时、否则宣战的最后通牒时，贝特曼 霍尔维格却大发雷霆，说他不能想象，英国与德国交战，仅仅是为了一张保证比利时中立的“废纸”。在后人回顾导致第一次世界大战爆发的种种荒诞原因中，恐怕没有什么比德国首相的这句名言更能说明情况了。
<br><br>
边缘的角色
<br><br>
1373年，英王爱德华三世与葡萄牙国王斐迪南一世和王后埃莉诺签署了同盟条约，以对抗法国与卡斯蒂里亚王国（西班牙前身之一）的联盟。1386年，英王爱德华三世之子、兰开斯特公爵约翰 冈特谋取卡斯蒂里亚王位（他的女儿凯瑟琳嫁给了卡斯蒂里亚国王）失败之后，把另一个女儿菲利帕（英国兰开斯特王朝开国君主亨利四世的妹妹）嫁给了葡萄牙国王约翰一世。
<br><br>
为了巩固英葡联盟，约翰一世和约翰 冈特于1386年在温莎城堡签订了《温莎条约》，这也是世界上现存最古老的外交同盟条约。菲利帕 兰开斯特与约翰一世所生的几位王子，特别是“航海家亨利”，对十四世纪葡萄牙海外帝国的崛起产生过巨大的影响，被誉为“超凡的一代（王子）”。
<br><br>
由1373年英葡条约、1386年温莎条约，以及1643年、1654年、1660年、1661年、1703年、1815年、1899年、1904年和1914年续签的各条约所确立的英葡同盟一直存在了六个世纪之久，只有1580-1640年葡萄牙与西班牙合并时期中断过六十年。除此之外，在西班牙王位继承战争、七年战争、拿破仑战争、第一次世界大战中，葡萄牙都忠实地站在英国一方作战。
<br><br>
一战爆发之初，德属西南非洲（纳米比亚）和德属东非（坦桑尼亚）的德国殖民当局一边从葡属安哥拉和莫桑比克走私食品和药物，一边煽动当地部落起义。两地的葡萄牙殖民当局都宣布关闭边界，并且从葡萄牙本土调来了增援部队。1916年2月23日，在英国的要求下，葡萄牙开始没收停泊在其港口内的德奥船只，3月9日德国对葡萄牙宣战。在当年6月召开的协约国财政部长会议上，规定战后将把1894年德国从葡属莫桑比克夺走的基昂加三角洲地区（面积一千平方公里）还给葡萄牙。
<br><br>
1916年8月，葡萄牙议会批准向法国战场派去五万六千名军人。但是由于船运能力不足，葡萄牙最终只运去了两个师。在第一次世界大战的西线和非洲战场，有八千多名葡萄牙军人阵亡，一万三千余人负伤，一万两千人被俘或失踪，九十六艘葡萄牙船只被德国潜艇击沉。葡萄牙在巴黎和会上获得的基昂加三角洲瘴疟横行，无法开发，与葡萄牙在战争中的损失相比，只能说是一个微不足道的补偿。
<br><br>
从十九世纪末到二十世纪上半叶，暹罗（泰国）以高超的外交技巧游走于列强之间，虽然在经济上沦为英法的半殖民地，并且丧失了大片领土，但仍保持住了独立地位。近代泰国的进步得益于一个开明的国王群体，从拉玛四世到拉玛五世，再到后来的拉玛六世，接受西方教育的时间越来越长，也越来越完整。一战爆发时在位的暹罗国王拉玛六世在1894年时即去英国留学，攻读英语、法语和法律，当时他年仅十三岁。1900年他加入英国陆军，以学习英国的先进军事制度。在回国之前，他还游历了美国和日本，拜访过西奥多 罗斯福总统，参观了西点军校，在访问日本时还曾向明治天皇请教开化治国之道。
<br><br>
1914年8月，第一次世界大战在欧洲爆发，远在地球另一边的暹罗密切注视着欧洲的动向。战争刚一爆发，拉玛六世国王就下令在欧洲各国留学或服役的各位王子迅速回国。暹罗历史上饱受英法欺凌，而德国人却以纯粹商人的身份给暹罗带来了许多先进的产品，德国货为当时的暹罗人所喜爱，因此不免爱屋及乌，对德国抱有好感，国内一批人借此机会要求参加同盟国一方，同英法作战，收复湄公河东岸和马来省的失地。但是拉玛六世在英国留学时，便已深知暹罗之所以能摆脱沦为洋人殖民地的危险，是因为它偶然幸运地处于英法两国的夹缝之中。他深知英法两国实力的强大，因此宣布暹罗保持中立。直到1917年，随着美国加入协约国，以及中国对德宣战，拉玛六世才下决心加入战争，“为祖国争取荣誉”。<br><br>
1917年7月22日，拉玛六世召集内阁及国务顾问团，宣布暹罗对德国、奥地利和匈牙利宣战。当天夜里，曼谷的警察全部出动，抓了一夜德国人。德奥侨民在暹罗的财产全被扣押，暹罗海军还将为逃避协约国军舰追捕而逃入暹罗港口的四十多艘德国货船全部没收。
<br><br>
1918年6月，由一千两百八十四名志愿者组成的暹罗远征军前往法国，与协约国共同作战，远征军包括一个飞行大队（未参战）、一个汽车兵运输大队和一个与美军协同作战的步兵大队。1919年6月28日，暹罗以战胜国的身份在《凡尔赛和约》上签字，随后又成为国际联盟的成员国。为了表彰暹罗在一战中追随协约国参战的贡献，英法等国在战后取消了在暹罗的领事裁判权，并将关税自主权归还给暹罗。

“君子和而不同”的解读<br><br>
 本刊特约记者  林治波<br><br>



“以和为贵”是中国文化的根本特征和基本价值取向。“君子和而不同”正是对“和”这一理念的具体阐发。“和而不同”追求内在的和谐统一，而不是表象上的相同和一致。今天，“和而不同”是人类共同生存的基本条件和基本法则。
<br><br>
笔者以为，在孔子的思想体系中，有两个观点极具现实价值：一个是“己所不欲，勿施于人”，另一个就是“君子和而不同”。前者已被《世界人类责任宣言》确定为全球治理的“黄金规则”；后者对于我们构建和谐社会和多元世界具有重要的启示意义。<br><br>
在人与人、人与自然的关系上，中国传统文化历来主张平衡和谐，“以和为贵”是中国文化的根本特征和基本价值取向。“君子和而不同”正是对“和”这一理念的具体阐发。<br><br>
这句话出自《论语・子路第十三》。原话是：“君子和而不同，小人同而不和。”何晏《论语集解》对这句话的解释是：“君子心和然其所见各异，故曰不同；小人所嗜好者同，然各争利，故曰不和。”就是说，君子内心所见略同，但其外在表现未必都一样，比如都为天下谋，有些人出仕做官，有些人则教书育人，这种“不同”可以致“和”；小人虽然嗜好相同，但因为各争私利，必然互起冲突，这种“同”反而导致了“不和”。<br><br>
其实，“和”与“同”的概念，最早不是孔子提出来的。《国语》和《左传》中都有史伯与晏子议论“和”“同”的记载，比如史伯在《国语・郑语》中说：“以他平他谓之和。”这里的“他”有“不同”的意思，在不同中寻找相同相近的事物或道理，也就是寻求“和”的过程。史伯和晏子从哲学和自然规律上来讲“和”与“同”，孔子则将其引申到社会领域，用以阐释做人的道理，视为区别“君子”与“小人”的特征之一，可见孔子对“和”的重视。<br><br>
宋儒注重义利之辩，认为义、利水火不容，即所谓“君子喻于义，小人喻于利”。在何晏注解的基础上，宋儒更明确地以义利观来解释“和而不同”，认为君子的“和”是“义”的结果，小人的“同”是“利”的驱使。这种解释思路一直延续到清末，比如刘宝楠《论语正义》所说的“和因义起，同由利生”，与宋儒一脉相承。<br><br>
孔子的本意是否如此，或者说，孔子是否认同后人的解释，不得而知。笔者以为，对“君子和而不同”的理解，在当今时代似应超越“义”“利”的道德范畴，而上升到思想方法和处事哲学的高度加以阐释。<br><br>
从哲学意义上讲，“和”是和谐，是统一，“同”是相同，是一致；“和”是抽象的，内在的；“同”是具体的，外在的。“和而不同”，就是追求内在的和谐统一，而不是表象上的相同和一致。<br><br>
这里，“君子和而不同”似乎可以区分为两种情况：<br><br>
就自身而言，高明的人总是与别人相协调，但并不盲目地重复或附和别人，因协调而不重复故能达成和谐；不高明的人，见到旁人的成功就一窝蜂随大流地摹仿别人，反而引起恶性竞争，最终导致不和谐。这里可以举一个例子：美国开发西部的早期，曾一度形成了淘金热，各地的人们纷纷奔赴西部淘金。而一个叫史密斯的人，也想借此发财，但他不是直接像别人那样去淘金，而是去向淘金的人卖水。结果，许多淘金者空手而归，史密斯却大发一笔，从此成了富翁。他顺应了淘金的潮流，这是“和”；但他没有重复别人，这是“不同”，合起来就是“和而不同”，所以他比别人高明，发财是对高明的应有报偿。<br><br>
对他人而言，高明的人总是追求和谐，为此而包容差异，在丰富多彩中达成和谐；不高明的人，总是强求一致，因容不得差异而往往造成矛盾冲突。比如，一个乐队，想要演奏出和谐美妙的音乐，需要使用十几种乃至几十种不同的乐器，各奏其乐，各发其声，从而汇成宏大动听的交响乐。反之，如果乐队中都使用同一种乐器，其单调乏味是可想而知的。再比如，用乱石砌墙、碎石铺路，一块块乱石奇形怪状，一块块碎石各不相同，但墙一旦砌成，风格和谐统一，路一旦铺就，犹如一体天成。又比如，生物分雌雄，动物分公母，人类分男女，倘若世界上只有同一个性别，无法交媾，也就无法造就新的生命。我们的世界本来就是，也应当是一个“和而不同”的多样性的世界。<br><br>
黑格尔似乎也认识到了这个道理。他把“同一”区分为两种：一种是“抽象的同一”―――“排斥一切差别的同一”；另一种是“具体的同一”―――“包含差别于自身的同一”。他认为这是在哲学上区别好坏的关键，并且说：“如果思维活动只不过是一种抽象的同一，那么我们就不能不宣称此类思维是最无益最无聊的。”笔者以为，黑格尔这里所说的“包含差别于自身的同一”，用中国哲学的概念表达，也就近似于“和而不同”。<br><br>
在经济全球化的今天，“和而不同”这一两千多年前的古老观念仍然具有强大的生命活力，仍然可以成为现代社会发展的一项准则和一个目标。“和而不同”，是世界多元文化共同繁荣发展的必由之路；反之，“同而不和”就必然导致纷争乃至战争。现在，人类拥有的核武器可以在瞬息之间毁灭地球和人类自身。如果只强求“同”而不谋求“和”，矛盾冲突激化而导致核大战，那结果只能是共同毁灭，所以说，“和而不同”是人类共同生存的基本条件和基本法则。<br><br>
这样看来，“和因义起，同由利生”的传统解释就显出了某种局限性。实际上，“和”可以因“义”而起，也可以因“利”而起，即便不讲“义”而仅言“利”，也应当求“和”，因为不“和”不仅不“义”，也不“利”。反过来说，言“利”未必生“同”，如果不是仅仅图一时之利、区区之利，而谋“长远之利”、“宏大之利”，就必须走“和而不同”之路。这也说明，“义”与“利”不一定是对立的关系，还是可以形成统一的。当然，由“义”而生“和”，同因“利”而致“和”，还是有所区别的，前者是自觉的、主动的，后者是消极的、被动的。<br><br>
那么，怎样才能达成“和”的局面呢？实际上，孔子已为我们指明了答案―――“不同”，也就是不强求一致，不重复别人。只有在大目标不冲突的前提下，承认差异，包容差异，乃至尊重差异，才能化解矛盾，共存共荣。<br><br>
只要愿意共存共荣，就必然要磨合。磨合就是通过接触、交流、对话来建立共识，以达到“和”的目的。事实上，各国各民族不同的文明一直处于时断时续、时好时坏的磨合之中。磨合得好，才能比较顺利地从经济全球化过渡到文化上的多元一体，经过不断的磨合，最终进入“天下大同”的境界。这里的“大同”，是内在的和谐统一，而不是外在的相同一致，实质上就是“和而不同”的理想境界。<br><br>
可见，“和而不同”所表现出来的文化宽容与文化共享的情怀，不仅具有伦理价值，还具有思想方法、工作方法和处世哲学的意义。<br><br>
党的十六大和十六届三中、四中全会提出构建社会主义和谐社会，并把提高构建社会主义和谐社会的能力作为加强党的执政能力建设的重要内容，这反映了我们党对执政规律、执政能力、执政方略、执政方式的新认识，也体现了我们党对中国优良传统文化的继承和发扬。<br><br>
所谓“和谐社会”，应该是民主法治、公平正义、诚信友爱、充满活力、安定有序、人与自然和谐相处的社会；应该是各尽其能、各得其所而又和谐相处的社会；从某种角度看，也应该是“和而不同”的社会。<br><br>
费孝通老先生在80寿辰聚会上，曾经意味深长地讲了一句16字箴言：“各美其美，美人之美，美美与共，天下大同”。这是对“君子和而不同”的极好的阐释。<br><br>

西方要走社会主义道路，中国怎么办？<br><br>
 杨恒均 <br><br>
 2014年5月30日 <br><br>
43岁的法国人皮凯迪以《二十一世纪的资本论》一夜暴红。在这本长达六、七百页的经济学巨著中，他研究了西方国家两个世纪里的税收与财富分配资料，指出资本收入永远大于经济增长率，资本的报酬率大于劳动报酬率，拥有资本的人越来越有钱，资本相对缺乏的人越来越贫穷。收入的不平等造成贫富差距，加大不平等，长此下去，将造成社会不公、不正，伤害民主制度，危害社会稳定！
<br><br>
 

虽然皮凯迪是通过细致的资料收集与数字分析得出这样的结论，但这个结论其实大家一眼都能看出来，例如10％的美国人拥有70％的财富，其中一半又被1％的人所拥有。不过，皮凯迪则提出了引起广泛关注的解决办法，其中最重要的一条是在全球范围内对富人扣掉负债以后的资产扣累进税，累进最高的程度可以扣到80％，越富征越多税……用这种方法重新分配财富，缩小贫富差距，也让社会更加平等。让资本为民主服务，而不是让民主论为资本的奴隶。
<br><br>
 

如果马克思泉下有知，一定会大笑而醒：皮凯迪的理论证实马克思至少对了一半：社会主义是资本主义的高级阶段，资本主义到了一定的时候，一定会――对了，不是靠无产阶级手中的镰刀和斧头，而是靠他们手中的选票――弄出一个更加平等、公平的“社会主义” ……

 <br><br>

要知道，资本主义制度是资本家建立在资本之上的，宪政民主最重要的一条就是用最清晰的宪法条文保护了私人财产的神圣不可侵犯，所以，哪怕以民主的名义――包括全民投票的方式，也无法剥夺任何一位资本家的私人财富。所以只能眼巴巴看着打着平等旗号的西方国家的富人们越来越富，贫富差距越来越大。――皮凯迪在此书中开出了用征收富人高额税的办法来“均贫富”的“药方”。
<br><br>
 

而且，在民主制度下是可行的，也是合法的。政府和国会有权对国民征税，且没有被宪法设定上限。征税的权力又掌握在民选的总统与民选代表（众议员、参议员）手里。任何国家的穷人都会远远多于富人，一旦穷人们达成共识，用选票选上那些――例如被资本家们指责为“社会主义份子”的奥巴马和同意对富人征收高达80％的累进税的国会议员，西方国家也就走上“社会主义道路”了――一个有民主的“社会主义”也就不再是梦想。
<br><br>
 
<a href= "pic78.html">德语名言：哲学智慧（1）</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic206.html">Harry Potter 核心情节</a><br><br>

皮凯迪的这一“药方”颇受主张征收富人税的美国自由派经济学者和奥巴马的青睐。奥巴马政府的财政部长等高级经济顾问已同皮凯迪进行了频繁地接触。当然，皮凯迪开出的“药方”真要在西方尤其是美国实行恐怕并不容易，再说一个国家内的征税也不实际，富翁们会以转移资产到海外而逃税，一旦被讥讽为要走“社会主义道路”的奥巴马下台，共和党一定会“正本清源”，重弹资本家追求财富的欲望创造了就业，血淋淋的资本繁荣了社会的老调……<br><br>

 

但皮凯迪的“药方”对已经以“穿越”的速度提前跨进社会主义初级阶段的中国又如何呢？为什么在看他写西方的这本书时，我脑袋里始终想到的是中国，而不是美国，更不是澳洲？而且我越来越倾向认为皮凯迪收集了英美法的资料研究出的结论、开出的“药方”，用在中国身上，不但适合，好象更加合适呢？
<br><br>
 

虽然没有确切的数字显示中国的财富集中程度以及贫富差距大小，可凭我的观察与直觉得出的结论不会太离谱：中国的财富集中与贫富差距绝对不会低于皮凯迪书中研究的那些西方国家。劳动阶层通过劳动，甚至知识阶层通过知识已经很难积累像样的财富。拥有资本的人却越来越富。
<br><br>
 

所不同的是：西方资本制度经过百年发展，加上有宪政保护，已经合法化了，民众虽觉得不公，却也不会生出愤怒从而想夺取；而中国的资本大多同权力无法脱钩，不得不遮遮掩掩，且不少资本的毛孔里还不时渗出一些肮脏的血液和贪腐的浓汁，更糟糕的是，中国的“资本家”们并没有像西方资本家那样靠资本控制住国家，弄出一部无论如何都能保住他们私产的宪法，所以中国的资本一边担心“暴政”随时会来抄家，一边又担忧某一天会被“暴民”剥夺……正因为资本的这个属性，财富高度集中与贫富之间的悬殊差距在社会主义的中国反而比在资本主义的美国更容易引起社会不公不正，更容易导致社会不稳定。

 <br><br>

现在，西方资本主义国家准备采取传统社会主义国家强调的平等与公正，以对富人征收高额税收来削减、控制资本的“药方”，社会主义中国准备怎么办？有理由相信，这届政府的经济高参们不会放着这本开出现成“药方”的书置之不理，事实上，如果大家读一下习总在政治局5月26日下午就使市场在资源配置中起决定性作用和更好发挥政府作用进行第十五次集体学习中的讲话，就会有种似曾相识的感觉：习总在强调市场那只“看不见的手”时，同时强调了政府这只“看得见的手”。
<br><br>
 

如果中国真想按照皮凯迪开出的“药方”，用对暴富阶层征收高额税收的办法来打破资本的垄断与世袭，缩小贫富差距，营造一个平等、公正公平的社会，维护社会稳定，显然比西方国家要容易操作得多。毕竟中国还是社会主义国家啊，征税的效率要远远高于西方。

 <br><br>

也正因为这样，我才要提醒一下：皮凯迪毕竟是在研究英、美、法等西方宪政民主制与法治国家的基础上开出的那剂“药方”，如果我们不顾制度因素与客观条件而生搬硬套，病急乱投医，很可能没有实现“均富”，反而退回到了“均贫”的时代，甚至重演“打土豪、分田地”的历史……

 <br><br>

习总“看不见”与“看得见”的两手能否开出更好的“药方”，解决财富过份集中、贫富差距拉大与社会不公？让西方资本主义国家走社会主义道路，中国继续走自己的路吧？！<br><br>

克里米亚：理想与现实，光荣与梦想<br><br>
 杨恒均 <br><br>
 2014年3月21日  <br><br>
各位同学好，克里米亚人家讲得够多了，我今天讲更大一点的，好不好？<br><br>

 

中国在联合国投弃权票是不错的选择。中国恐怕是在联合国安理会投最多弃权票的国家吧？以前中国的国际地位较低时，投弃权票总给人一种无奈和逃避的印象，但强大了后再投弃权票就不同了，给人一种进退由我，展示力量的感觉。正如同样是“韬光养晦”，贫弱时是别无选择，强大时是选择在我，这在国际博弈中可并不是同一个概念。<br><br>

 

现在老是听到有人叫喊要丢掉“韬光养晦”，他们都以普京为精神教父。他们说你看普京就敢对西方对世界说“不”。在他们看来，敢说“不”就是丢掉了“韬光养晦”。殊不知，一个国家的外交应该为国家利益、国家安全与国家稳定以及更重要的经济发展与人民生活的改善为标准。说“不”谁不会？中国那几年饿死好多人时我们全国人民都在对世界说“不”，连有国家想援助咱们，都被“不”掉了，很牛B吗？
<br><br>
 

普京为什么要说“不”？那是因为西方根本不尿他，他说不说“不”，在国际上区别并不大，他的“不”从来没有给俄国带来利益，可他为啥还要说“不”？因为这个“不”是说给俄国人听的，他要用这个“不”塑造自己硬汉的形象，激起俄国人的民族主义情感，然后，确保自己能够当一位终身的“民选总统”。这是普京的梦想啊。<br><br>

 

普京2000年上台后，国际油价一路飙升，他仗着自己的这点好运气，俨然把自己打扮成复兴俄国的“普京大帝”，其实这个前克格勃心里很清楚，整个克格勃都不是人家的对手，靠你一个背叛原组织的中级克格勃干部就想翻转乾坤？普京也知道自己现在最大的依仗其实是推翻克格勃之后建立起来的俄国民主制度，而俄罗斯的民主制度几乎全部仰赖叶利钦执政的八年。那段时间虽然生活艰难，但俄罗斯的民主基础毕竟打下千年基业。普京一边吃石油老本，一边啃制度的老本，还同时做着“普京大帝”的梦。

 <br><br>

各位知道，在外交关系领域，粗分为现实主义（功利主义）和理想主义（以意识形态与理念为主），虽说现实主义在近现代一直占主导地位，但理想主义始终若即若离。我是这样划分中美两国外交实践的：美国是有理想的现实主义者，中国是现实的理想主义者。“现实”差别不大，理想却不尽相同：美国推崇的自由民主，中国推崇中国特色的社会主义民主。美国虽有理想，但常常为了现实利益而理念上做出妥协，中国虽然比较现实，但也会为了执政党领导和国家稳定这样的信念而在现实中做出让步。正因为中美两国的“妥协”和“让步”，才使得“新型大国关系”成为可能。
<br><br>

<a href= "pic44.html">挑战原文：End the Slavery Blame-Game</a><br><br>

俄罗斯呢，却是一个不折不扣的现实主义者。当然，这不能全怪他，前苏联可是一个超级理想主义者，怀抱社会主义理念与解放全人类的理想，建立了社会主义大家庭，试图蚕食西方资本主义，结果弄到最后，社会主义阵营不但没有击败西方世界，当头的苏联反倒成了唯一一个被不友好的社会主义国家包围的国家――中国反对他，南斯拉夫、捷克、波兰，哪一个对他有好感？
<br><br>
 

好不容易土崩瓦解，也建立了民主制度，可西方就是对他不冷不热，当初答应解散北约的承诺不但不兑现，反而变本加厉，一路东扩，包抄俄国。在这种情况下，俄罗斯是有苦难言，民主这东西是无法回头的，社会主义理想又不知道丢到哪里去了。所以，普京的俄罗斯外交就采取了两边理想都不沾边的纯粹的现实主义――没有理想的现实主义，或者说功利主义，是很可怕的。就像一个没有信仰的唯利是图的家伙，是相当难缠的。
<br><br>
 

但现实主义也不是那么好弄的。我们知道现实主义外交是要靠实力的，俄罗斯有啥实力？出卖石油的钱勉强够改善民生以保证他继续当选，不足以在国际上呼风唤雨。但普京比谁都聪明――当过特务又没有被灭掉，一般都比较聪明，这个你们都知道吧――在没有理想，现实主义又无法走出国门的情况下，要想民众视他为英雄，觉得少了他就会被外国人欺负到家门口，唯一的办法就是煽动民族主义，就是习惯性地站出来反对西方，把“不”字挂在嘴边。
<br><br>
 

所以这些年，普京能对西方尤其是美国说“不”的，绝不会吝啬，绝不会犹豫，虽然在国际上说了等于没说，但他却在那批苏联时代培养起来的“俄国人民”中逐步享受到极高的声誉。我们看到，很少提民主自由，也不敢多提前苏联意识形态的俄国，“普京”成了他们的“意识形态”，成了他们的“理想”。这个时候，克里米亚又如从天而降的馅饼，给了普京天赐良机。
<br><br>
 

普京是要定了克里米亚。而且，克里米亚兼入俄国，对俄国的国家利益与安全来说，还真是百利而无一害。至于西方能够做的，非常有限。普京不会害怕军事干涉的。苏联是在意识形态与意志的对决中败给美国的，而不是败在真枪真刀的对垒中。这一点普京很清楚，他宁愿兵戎相见，绝不愿意再拿理念与信念来对抗美国。
<br><br>
 

美国也很清楚，所以他也不会动用武力。至于经济制裁，俄国的经济支柱是石油，美国的页岩气还没有成批量生产，暂时无法取代石油，普京也不愿意看那么远。至于限制贸易往来之类的，不要忘记还有中国。世界第二大经济体，除了尖端武器其它啥都造得出的中国不加入的经济制裁，能有什么效果？更何况，俄国是除了尖端武器之外啥都造不出的国家。

 <br><br>

苏联这个时候跳出来同美国对抗，对中国来说当然不只是经济和军事方面的“利好”，政治方面更是不可估量。在中美两国“新型大国关系”就差临时门一脚时，普京同美国的对抗，多少可以帮助美国更现实、更清醒一些，不要再整天想着和平演变北京，你的“敌人”还是北极熊啊，中国只不过是一只熊猫嘛。

<a href= "pic71.html">德语名言：政治经济（1）</a><br><br>

至于有人说中国应该借机联合俄国对抗美国，我说你肯定是想多了，美国你是对抗不掉的，既然对抗不掉，花那个人力、物力和精力折腾啥？而联合俄国更是味同嚼蜡，毫无必要，更何况从长远来说，俄国的变数实在太大了，普京下台或者死去，就会让俄国一夜之间变天――那时，没有了“普京大帝”的俄国人除了拥抱自由民主之外，还有什么选择？但中国有选择，那就是没有必要把自己同任何一个大国绑在一起。

 <br><br>

克里米亚的问题很复杂，公说公有理，婆说婆有理，真要想分出对错时，你恐怕连判断对错的标准都无法统一。按照乌克兰宪法，克里米亚公投当然是非法的，但民族自决同追求民主自由一样，都是超越任何国家“宪法”的，否则世界上那么多殖民地和新建立的国家是如何独立的？当初苏联十五个加盟共和国又是如何不顾苏联宪法而投票独立的？
 <br><br>
 

克里米亚局势的复杂性还在于，普京兼并克里米亚不但打破了冷战后的国际关系格局，也忤逆了百年来的历史大趋势。什么是历史大趋势？大家都知道，过去一百年，大趋势是几乎所有大帝国都在瓦解（包括中国在内，外蒙等不是也被苏联弄走了），不停地分成更多的小国家。这个是从殖民地纷纷独立开始的，一直延续到苏联解体。俄国这次兼并克里米亚确实是这么多年来唯一一个大国不被分割，反而一下子增加了那么多国土面积(当然，这里不包括老毛子以前从我们手里夺走的那么大一片土地）。当然，俄国今后会为此付出怎样的代价，只有掉下馅饼的天知道。 <br><br>

 

中国在克里米亚问题上不做选择就是最好的选择，不选边站就是最好的立场。中国需要和平的国际环境，今后既要发展同美国不对抗、不冲突，合作双赢的“新型大国关系”，也要同俄国发展一种不结盟、不选边站的“新型大国关系”。另外，就是在注重发展同欧洲、美洲、澳洲等国家的多边关系时，加大力量和投入努力搞好同周边国家的关系。以上几大关系处理好了，世界上再发生几个克里米亚事件，对中国的利益与梦想又能有多大的损害？ <br><br>

 

杨恒均 2014.3.20 (根据19日同香港大学生谈话记录整理) <br><br>

世界上只有两个国家能够“随心所欲”地控制国家的总人口数字，要它增就增，要它减就减。一个是美国――通过移民人数来调剂人口总数。一个是中国，人口增长太快，使用计划生育，稍微控制住了，发现“人口红利”要用完了，又策划开始放开二胎。美国的办法并非良策，效果也不是太明显，因为过多的移民很可能会冲击这个国家的文化与价值观，造成政治上的负面影响，从长远来说，会得不偿失。

 <br><br>

从二战后多个国家的经验来看，“人口红利”是比政府有形的手与市场这只无形的手更能有效推动经济发展的杠杆。但真正能把“人口红利”当成发展经济杠杆的国家，只有中国。中国人天生的繁殖力强，“床上功夫”了得，稍微一放开，就让地球上每五个人中就有一个中国人，你再放开一些，今后等到三个或者两个人中有一位中国人的时候，哪怕中国大多数人都穷得叮当响，中国的经济总量也一定是世界第一。 

 <br><br>

中国政府能真正控制人口增减，你说是经济学还是政治学，又或者是生理卫生方面的知识？就凭这一点，西方所有的关于“人口红利”的诸如刘易斯拐点啊等等十六种相关理论与说法，就没有一个能够用在中国。类似这种中国特色，中国还有许多方面，例如，土地对经济的发展又是至关重要的，而中国是世界上唯一可以同美国相比的从寒带跨越到热带的国土面积大国，可世界上没有几个国家能像中国一样，土地属于国家，政府可以支配，可以拿来刺激、操纵、推动经济发展。
<br><br>
 

政府使用强大的政治力量与行政手段，在国际经济竞争中得心应手，任何一个超级的跨国公司如微软、苹果，无论从手里可用的资金与背后支持自己的“资源”来说，没有一个可以抗衡中国的超级“央企”、国家银行。即便在中国境内，也有一些世界其他国家无法想像的“优势”：一说发展汽车工业，各地突然上马好多个“汽车城”；一说把教育市场化，它一夜之间就能建立好多个“大学城”。大学生和汽车零件一样，都可以批量生产。质量如何不好说，但数量是绝对无法挑战的，GDP 也肯定能直线上升。汽车大国日本搞不了“汽车城”，教育大国美国没有“大学城”。<br><br>

一，乔布斯小时候是一个非常调皮――我觉得用“调皮”来形容可能太便宜他了，实际上，无论从行为还是学习成绩上，他都是一个“差”等生，在学校搞恶作剧达到了匪夷所思的程度，例如把鞭炮放在老师的椅子下点燃。但这样一个学生，竟然被学校容忍，而且一路顺风，这实在不能不归功于美国教育制度对孩子们的“一视同仁”与包容精神。对照乔布斯在学校的所作所为，说实话，如果放在中国，即便不送到管教“少年犯”的特殊学校接受再教育，即便不被学校开除，恐怕也早被戴上“绿领巾”。从这一点来说，乔布斯是“美国制造”一点不过。
<br><br>
二，一种鼓励年轻人创新、创业的社会环境。昨天刚好看到这样一条新闻：“4名90后广州大学生自行设计自制火箭准备升天。他们的“惊人之举”引起空管部门以及其他有关部门的关注。考虑到安全及天气等因素，这4位大学生首次探求太空之旅被叫停，实箭发射改为地面科学模拟，虽然也有一些收获，但毕竟还是有些遗憾”。航管部门叫停以及“相关部门”关注当然都有理由，而且也得到四位年轻人的理解。然而，如果你读了乔布斯，你会得出结论：不应该叫停这些年轻人的创举，应该创造条件――例如帮助他们把“火箭”运送到相对安全的地域――让他们去探索。<br><br>

三，车库――阅读乔布斯传前半部分时常常有“车库”两个字，乔布斯的“苹果一号”是在车库里组装的。这种情景让我想起一百年前（整整一百年前哦）发明了飞机的怀特兄弟，他们当时没有钱没有场地，竟然是在车库里发明了飞机。其实，还有很多发明，都是在“车库”里诞生的。这一方面说明西方人有一个车库，很多时候成为他们的手工作坊；另外一方面说明，伟大的发明并不需要那么多优厚的资源。就在乔布斯在车库里组装“苹果一号”的时候，至少有十几家拥有相当规模的电脑制造商正在豪华厂房里工作；就在怀特在车库里设计“飞机”的时候，当时就有几位拥有上百万美金的飞行爱好者也在研究飞行器。<br><br>

四，这点特别让我感动：至少有两次，乔布斯在鼓捣电脑时遇到了困难――他缺少零件之类的，结果这位才十几、二十多岁的年轻人竟然拿起电话，直接给当时的大老板打电话，开口就让人家提供免费的零件和支持，而让人惊讶的是，这些大老板竟然毫无条件的就答应了他，还送货上门，使得乔布斯对电脑的研究与制造可以继续下去。有时我想，如果他困难的时候，那些老板不支持与鼓励年轻人创新与创业，乔布斯还是乔布斯？他能走到今天？<br><br>
