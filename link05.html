	环球时报综合报道：“基地组织正在以暴力接管伊拉克!”在一伙极端分子占领伊拉克城市费卢杰（Fallujah），并公开宣布建立“伊斯兰酋长国”之后，西方媒体5日一片惊呼声。自2003年美国入侵伊拉克以来，与“基地”组织有关联的武装分子还是首次对重要城市如此公开地控制，这无疑是对美国主导的中东秩序的严重挑衅。

　　“最近几周暴力事件的升级有可能将伊拉克拉回内战最糟糕的时刻”，《波士顿环球报》称，当时美国通过入侵来参与伊拉克事务，并在这里花费数十亿美元，牺牲数千名士兵的生命。随着美国的撤军，很多努力化为灰烬。

　　费卢杰是美国人熟悉的战略重镇。在2003年美国领导的伊拉克战争打响后，费卢杰曾是两次猛烈袭击的目标，美军说那是自越南战争以后他们所看到的最猛烈的战斗。2006年年底以后，在逊尼派部落民兵武装的帮助下，美军经过数年的战斗才勉强从武装分子手中夺回对安巴尔省的控制权，但冲突一直不断。费卢杰几乎成为反美武装的大本营，被称为“抵抗之都”。根据独立网站“战争伤亡网站”的统计，美军在伊拉克战死的所有人数当中，死于安巴尔省的人数几乎占去1/3。

基地组织在伊拉克宣布建国

        本报综合消息 “基地组织正在以暴力接管伊拉克！”在一伙极端分子占领伊拉克城市费卢杰并公开宣布建立“伊斯兰酋长国”之后，西方媒体5日一片惊呼声。自2003年美国入侵伊拉克以来，与“基地”组织有关联的武装分子还是首次对重要城市如此公开控制，这无疑是对美国主导的中东秩序的严重挑衅。

    “基地”要建政教合一酋长国

    据法新社4日报道，在经过数天激烈战斗后，伊拉克政府失去对安巴尔省重镇费卢杰的控制，现在费卢杰已经落入与“基地”组织有联系的“伊拉克和叙利亚伊斯兰国”（ISIS）之手。与此同时，安巴尔省首府拉马迪也发生激战，仅3日一天，费卢杰和拉马迪两地的死亡人数就超过100人。法新社称，这是多年来安巴尔省遭受的最严重的暴力袭击事件，也是自2003年美国入侵伊拉克以来武装分子第一次对重要城市如此公开控制。

    《华盛顿邮报》援引一名当地记者的话报道称，“基地”组织的黑色旗帜上周五在费卢杰市政府建筑物上升起，“此刻，费卢杰似乎不是伊拉克的（城市）。警察和军队放弃了它。基地组织人员降下并焚烧伊拉克国旗，还在所有建筑上插上他们自己的旗帜。”这名记者说，数百名持枪“基地”武装人员当天包围了一个数千人参与的露天礼拜场所。一个蒙面的武装人员走上讲坛，宣布费卢杰为“伊斯兰国”，号召当地居民与他们一起对抗马利基政府。

    费卢杰并不是ISIS的唯一目标，英国路透社称，近几月来，ISIS正稳步收紧对逊尼派占主导地位的安巴尔省的控制，目的是建立一个横跨伊拉克、叙利亚边境地区的逊尼派穆斯林国家。本周对拉马迪和费卢杰的占领是“基地”组织多年来第一次对该地区最重要的城市的有效控制。

    最近两天，伊拉克政府军在安巴尔省展开多次军事行动。总理马利基4日发表电视讲话，发誓政府军将“继续战斗、决不退缩，直到把盘踞在安巴尔省的所有恐怖分子全部消灭，使该省人民免受恐怖主义威胁”。

    “基地”以最新化身卷土重来

    美联社称，安巴尔省是伊拉克面积巨大的沙漠地区，与叙利亚和约旦接壤，居民几乎全部是逊尼派穆斯林。在萨达姆统治结束之后，什叶派穆斯林崛起，逊尼派穆斯林被排除在权力之外，这使他们的愤怒火上浇油。从那时起，“基地”组织就在伊拉克建立起分支组织。现在，费卢杰落入ISIS手中，是该组织取得的又一胜利，近年来它们已经在整个地区制造了多股冲击波。它还是叙利亚最强大的反叛组织之一，在控制的领土上实行严格的伊斯兰法律，绑架和杀害任何批评他们统治的人。

    约旦《明天报》分析说，“基地”组织的整体战略，是想打通叙利亚和伊拉克之间的“战略走廊”，使其人员可以在两国之间自由往来，互为机动，为最终实现在更大范围内建立伊斯兰酋长国做铺垫。现在，“基地”组织的人员正在从叙利亚境内向伊拉克“外溢”，他们有丰富的战斗经验，武器也比较先进，许多人想在伊拉克“大干一番”，因为伊拉克境内政治混乱、教派冲突、社会碎片化都为他们在那里施展拳脚提供了合适的土壤。所谓“伊拉克和叙利亚伊斯兰国”，只是“基地”的一个阶段性成果，他们不会满足于此。

    “基地组织显然以其最新的化身――ISIS――卷土重来了”，美国《环球邮报》说，ISIS占领拉马迪和费卢杰并能够守住数天时间，表明它已经超越传统的爆炸和打了就跑的袭击战略。

    叙利亚内战正波及到伊拉克

    “基地”组织卷土重来，与中东局势密切相关。路透社说，ISIS在安巴尔省的建国事件反映出叙利亚内战正波及到伊拉克，威胁着该地区微妙的派系平衡。叙利亚内战主要是逊尼派穆斯林反叛组织同受到伊朗什叶派穆斯林支持的巴沙尔总统之间的战争。

    “基地组织最近几年的繁荣与中东权力真空有关”，《波士顿环球报》认为。该报称，最近几天的事件让人产生一种怪异的熟悉感，仿佛过去10年的恐怖场景又在回放：贝鲁特市的汽车爆炸，叙利亚不断恶化的内战，“基地”组织的蒙面枪手夺回费卢杰和拉马迪这两座当年众多美国士兵战死争夺的城市。但是这次席卷伊拉克、黎巴嫩和叙利亚的流血冲突也暴露了一些新的不稳定因素：一个后美国时代中东的出现，在这里没有任何一方有权力或者意愿来遏制该地区的宗派仇恨。

    “伊拉克处于一个危险的十字路口”，伊拉克亚述国际新闻社的危机感更重。该国存在着分裂成相互交战的小国的危险，小国由狭隘种族和部落观念所界定。


	
基地组织“建国”直戳伊拉克安全病灶 特约

来源：中国网 2014-01-07

虽然基地组织此次“宣布建国”恐怕只能是自唱自和的独白，但是建国事件所带来的冲击是十分巨大的，标志着极端主义势力和恐怖主义势力在“后美国时代”的伊拉克勃然兴起。
“基地组织”建国了，这个消息绝对够劲爆够轰动。在一伙极端分子占领伊拉克城市费卢杰，并公开宣布建立“伊斯兰酋长国”之后，全世界舆论都为之震惊。自从2003年美国入侵伊拉克以来，动荡不停的伊拉克国内冲突终于导致了“基地组织”在重镇费卢杰建国的“闹剧”。

“鲜血和生命”换来的胜利

此次“建国事件”的发生地是伊拉克西部省份安巴尔省境内的城市费卢杰。从地理上讲，费卢杰是伊拉克同叙利亚之间的交通要冲，费卢杰在伊拉克在首都巴格达以西约69公里处，南向即是幼发拉底河和底格里斯河的交汇点，战略意义重大。从经济意义上，费卢杰兴起于二战之后，随着伊拉克独立和石油美元的大量涌入，费卢杰开始逐步发展壮大，由曾经动荡一个名不见经传的小村庄成长为伊拉克国内东部著名的经济重镇。

在宗教意义上，费卢杰是伊拉克逊尼派穆斯林聚集的重要城市之一，其居民约95%是逊尼派穆斯林，而由于城内众多的逊尼派清真寺，费卢杰也被称为“清真寺之城”。由于逊尼派穆斯林在伊拉克国内处于相对少数，而且是萨达姆政权的力量重要来源。费卢杰与附近几个城镇一起组成了著名的“逊尼三角洲”，因此在2003年美国推翻萨达姆政权之后，费卢杰以及安巴尔省的逊尼派聚居区成为了反抗美军占领和伊拉克重建的重要据点。

在伊拉克战争之后，伊拉克的叛乱在安巴尔省内最为激烈，安巴尔省人民对占领军的敌对状态也特别强烈。所以直到2006年年底以后，在逊尼派部落民兵武装的帮助下，美军经过数年的战斗才勉强从武装分子手中夺回对安巴尔省的控制权。

不过美军接管安巴尔省之后，境内的武装冲突一直不断。在伊拉克阵亡的3000多名美军士兵中，超过1000多人都是在安巴尔省阵亡的。美军驻伊拉克部队2008年9月1日把安巴尔省的防务移交给伊方安全部队时，伊拉克军方就称美军的移交是以“生命和鲜血”为代价换来的。

开疆拓土的“基地组织”

此次“基地组织”能吸引全世界的眼球，很大程度上是因为“基地组织”宣布“建国”。虽然基地组织此次“宣布建国”恐怕只能是自唱自和的独白，毕竟没有任何一个国家会承认这个新建立的“小王国”，但是建国事件所带来的冲击是十分巨大的，标志着极端主义势力和恐怖主义势力在“后美国时代”的伊拉克勃然兴起。

其实“基地组织”在2002年被赶出阿富汗之后，美国人在全球范围内对基地组织领导人进行了十多年的全球追杀，2011年本・拉登在巴基斯坦被美军击毙，被世人视作“基地组织”组织架构和实力被严重削弱的表现。不过，随着近些年中东动荡后的乱局逐渐播散至整个北非、西亚、东非等地，“基地组织”也已经在世界的诸多角落建立了自己事实上的“领地”。

在非洲大陆的索马里、厄立特里亚、中非、马里等地，“基地组织”分支及其“盟友”乘着当地脆弱的国家政权和频发的族群冲突，以伊斯兰教为引导不断扩张势力；在北非的马格里卜国家，历经“阿拉伯动荡”之后的利比亚也逐渐被“基地组织”所渗透；在叙利亚、黎巴嫩、伊拉克、阿富汗等地，广袤的土地和复杂的地区局势，让激进的逊尼派极端主义思想得以在战火纷飞的乱局中不断生长。

事实上，在也门、伊拉克、叙利亚等纷乱频仍的国家内部，“基地组织”及其分支机构，已经建立了自己事实上的“地盘”，只不过并没有通过国际舆论“广而告之”罢了。此次伊拉克境内费卢杰的“建国”，只是扯出了近些年来尤其是2011年之后“基地组织”等极端主义组织扩张身影的影子，因此既在意料之外，也在情理之中。

为什么选中伊拉克

独特的地理位置和民族、宗教构成，在历史的长河中让伊拉克成为了中东的“四战之地”：东有强大波斯文明，以独特的什叶派宗教向外辐射，北有强大的土耳其，西有延顺地中海而来的外部势力，南有来自阿拉伯半岛正统逊尼派的影响。在这种地理位中，当伊拉克在历史上被英国和法国人在“一战”后拼凑起来，建立起现代意义上的国家的那一刻，就决定了伊拉克容易受到外部因素的影响而激发内部不同宗教派别、不同民族之间的紧张关系。

2003年美国推翻萨达姆政权之后，历经数年的准备，终于在2005年开始向伊拉克政府移交行政权力。由于逊尼派在萨达姆时期是政权的领导力量，因此在萨达姆倒台之后被什叶派在政治上进行压制。什叶派政治代表人马利基就在2006年担任总理之后，再次于2010年击败逊尼派政治联盟，在伊朗的支持下重登总理宝座。与此相应的是不少逊尼派政治力量开始在伊拉克中部和西部地区扩展自己的“地盘”，伊拉克事实上陷入了政治分裂之中。

2011年爆发的叙利亚危机及随后的叙利亚内战，伊拉克也被深深的卷入其中。作为伊朗和叙利亚之间的陆路通道，伊拉克政府事实上扮演了伊朗和叙利亚之间的运输通道的角色。不过伊拉克中部和西部的大部分逊尼派民众却十分同情叙利亚以逊尼派为主的反对派武装，因此伊拉克国内社会在叙利亚内战面前被撕裂为两个阵营。

由于自身重要的连接伊拉克和叙利亚的地理位置，加之本身的逊尼派地区属性，费卢杰的失守实际上是叙利亚国内“做大做强”的激进主义武装对伊拉克渗透的结果，更显现出伊拉克国内不同教派地区对于重大政治议题的分歧所造成的冲突态势。

在当前的伊拉克“基地”分支的武装力量，势力仍然相对弱小，不足以能够击垮伊拉克的安全部队。从现有态势来看，如果伊拉克的安全部队经过调整的话，占据火力和兵力优势的伊拉克安全部队重新夺回费卢杰应该不会需要费太长的时间。

“基地组织”在伊拉克建国折射的根本问题是伊拉克严重的安全危机：不断升级的暴力冲突，频繁发生的武装袭击，加上部落部族武装形成的多方对峙的混战态势，以及伊拉克国内各个教派和区域之间的相互倾轧。尽管此次基地组织“浑水摸鱼”的实际威胁有限，却揭示出伊拉克国内安全的重大隐患。

Iraq: The Struggle for Truth in Fallujah
9 March 2014
Sunil Pate

As violence in Fallujah escalates to near-unprecedented levels, the entire narrative of the fighting seems to evade a number of key points. Namely, this fighting was not precipitated by the capture of Sunni strongholds by al-Qaeda or the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS).

The precursor to the fighting between Iraqi government forces and Sunni tribesmen of Anbar was a result of a ruthless policy of repression, aimed at nationwide protest camps opposing government measures on public services, counterterrorism, illegal house raids and a perpetuation of sectarian violence, as well as a number of other policies that continue to marginalize Sunni communities.

The Ramadi protest camps in al-Anbar have been at the center of demonstrations for the past year. It was on December 30  ― a week after Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had threatened to "burn down" the camps ― that special forces (SWAT) and the army descended upon the Ezz and Karama Square to crush protests, which had gained momentum after the arrest of Sunni MP Ahmed al-Alwani and the murder of his brother and five of his security guards.

Two witnesses reported to Human Rights Watch that SWAT and the army had arrived in a procession of military Humvees, pick-up trucks, and armored vehicles to clear the squares. All this just seven hours after Defense Minister Saadoun al-Dulaimi had negotiated the release of Alwani on the condition that the camps were to be cleared within 48 hours.

This is not the first attempt by government forces to clear protest camps. In April 2013, SWAT and the army opened fire on more than a thousand protestors in Hawija, south of Kirkut, killing 50 people and leaving 110 injured. The event passed without as much as a whimper in the press, let alone widespread condemnation.

The only difference between the events in Hawija and what happened in Ramadi was that, in the latter case, tribal militias decided to pick up their guns and fight back ― the repercussions, two months later, can be witnessed in the form of heavy aerial bombardment of Fallujah.

As fighting has escalated, the role of tribal militias has become watered down and has taken a backseat to the widely accepted, yet unproven mantra that "al-Qaeda-linked" ISIS is among half of the resistance faction that have seized Fallujah.

According to an Interior Ministry official, half of Fallujah has fallen to ISIS, while the other is "in the hands of tribesmen."

Who is Fighting the Iraqi Forces?

There are two important issues that must be highlighted here. The first of which is that claims of ISIS being the dominant group in the opposition seem to be unsubstantiated. There is no solid basis to validate any statement that ISIS is even present in large contingents in Fallujah, let alone playing a significant role in the fighting.

A group of prominent Anbari tribal leaders led by Sheikh Ali Hatem al-Salman, the Emir of the Dulaim tribe, has insisted that this confrontation is between the tribes and the government and they will continue fighting until their demands are met.

Feirut Alaani, a French-Iraqi journalist, has reported that ISIS is not playing a significant role in the fighting in Fallujah. Much has been said about ISIS raising a flag over a building in Fallujah, as this has been widely accepted as a sign of their power within the city. Yet Alaani argues: "They took their flag down five minutes later when ordered to by tribal leaders. This shows that tribes control Fallujah."

The only evidence that seems to give any credibility to government claims about a sizeable ISIS presence in the city is the statement of an anonymous member of the Tribal Revolutionaries Council, who confirmed that ISIS members had arrived in Fallujah on January 3. According to the council member: 

"Tribal gunmen surrounded the al-Qaeda gunmen as soon as they arrived... The Fallujah tribes didn’t  clash with al-Qaeda, but they didn’t coordinate with it either. It was agreed that [al-Qaeda would] move to the outside of the city of Fallujah, and that did happen."

If there is even the slightest bit of truth about this statement, then it does nothing further than prove that ISIS is present. However, it renders government claims about the capture of the city by the group as implausible, since the statement refers to ISIS operations being relegated to the outskirts of the city, which has avoided the majority of the violence in the last two months.

The fact that the anonymous source used al-Qaeda and ISIS interchangeably in further statements leads to a second important point: ISIS is not the Iraqi face of al-Qaeda.

It becomes a rather arduous task to highlight this point when the vast majority of media agencies continue to parrot a headline that has made ISIS sound like a surrogate of al-Qaeda, as opposed to a separate radical outfit that has its own agenda.

Maliki has constantly reiterated the rhetoric during the course of the fighting that al-Qaeda-linked militants must be driven out. It is more than just rhetoric at the moment; it is now his casus belli to heavily bombard Fallujah, perhaps to further cripple a city that has been the most vocal about Maliki’s indifference to Sunnis.

The name which seems to link al-Qaeda with ISIS is that of the shadowy figure of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. According to US officials, he was the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) C which later went on to become ISIS by including al-Sham (the Levant). His group was reported to be operating in Iraq at the behest of al-Qaeda, after he pledged his allegiance to Osama bin Laden in 2004.

The problem for the White House, however, is there appears to be no solid evidence that the man ever existed in the first place. Prior to being "killed" in 2006, Zarqawi was never seen or captured alive. He was never mentioned before the Iraq War and his entire past has no coherent script.

If we are to accept that he did exist, then his allegiance to al-Qaeda does not mean that ISIS was al-Qaeda’s extension in Iraq. US intelligence during the war cited al-Qaeda’s frustration with ISIS, as the group refused to follow orders. Even Donald Rumsfeld said that Zarqawi may have been more of a rival of al-Qaeda as opposed to being its lieutenant. 

If there were any doubts about this, they should surely be dispelled by a statement released on February 2 from the al-Qaeda general command. "ISIS is not a branch of the Qaidat al-Jihad [al-Qaeda's official name] group, we have no organizational relationship with it, and the group is not responsible for its actions." 

It is not hard to see why this has gone ignored. To offer a pretext in which the Iraqi government is fighting al-Qaeda affiliates in Fallujah not only evokes sympathy across the media, but also unlocks doors to the US Congress who needs no second invitation for getting involved in any fight that involves al-Qaeda.

How Involved is the US?

The Obama administration has wasted no time in expressing its concern over the "al-Qaeda-linked ISIS" and its growing influence, not just in the fighting in Fallujah but in Iraq as a whole.

The Pentagon has pledged its support to the "struggle" by promising to deliver 24 Apache helicopters, 175 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, Scan Eagle and Raven reconnaissance drones ― some of these have either been delivered or are pending delivery. These are just among a few items on the shopping list that is worth up to $4.7 billion.

The Wall Street Journal also cited State Department and Pentagon figures who stated: "As of January 2013, the US had more than 12,500 contractors in Iraq." Some of these contractors are military specialists helping the Iraqi military maintain its growing number of surveillance drones, attack helicopters and powerful missiles. The statistics run contrary to Secretary of State John Kerry’s statements that the US will not be putting their boots on the ground and that fighting in Fallujah is "their fight."

Humanitarian Situation

Fallujah is quickly plunging toward its most violent period of violence since 2004. Government forces and government-contracted tribesmen belonging to the Sahwa group ― Sunni tribesmen who were the key components in the US policy to drive ISIS out during the Iraq War ― have surrounded Fallujah in an attempt to regain control of the city.

Over 100 people have been killed, with over 530 wounded in a relentless campaign of shelling. According to the United Nations (UN), almost 370,000 people have been left homeless, without any access to water and electricity due to daily bomb attacks. Several bridges, which are the only channels for the besieged citizens to receive any food, have also been utterly destroyed.

Just last week, the Fallujah General Hospital was bombed, killing nearly all the doctors, nurses and patients, forcing the hospital into closure. Almost 44 Sunni MPs have resigned from their post due to the Iraqi government’s methods in the fighting.

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon and the UN Assistance Mission to Iraq have continued to plead with Maliki to provide humanitarian aid and negotiate an end to the fighting. But the response he received was that "we don’t negotiate with terrorists."

The crisis further adds to the trauma that inflicted Fallujah in 2004. During that year, two US sieges of the city aimed at tackling Sunni insurgents saw between 3,000 to 6,000 civilians killed, while 300,000 people fled to seek refuge elsewhere. The brutality of Operation Vigilante Resolve and Operation Phantom Fury can be seen in the increase of children being born with severe birth defects ― since the US-led sieges.

The Future of Iraq?

The scenes in Fallujah are not surprising if we base it upon what happened across the country in 2013. Iraqi people have grown accustomed to sectarian violence since Saddam Hussein was toppled, but 2013 alone was one of the worst years for Sunni-Shi'ite violence since 2006-2007.

More than 7,818 civilians and 1,050 members of security forces were killed in sectarian violence over the past year. More than 5,000 of the casualties were from attacks after April 2013, the same month in which government forces raided the Hawija camps. It would not be off the mark to suggest that Maliki’s policies of disenfranchisement and isolation of the Sunni community has had a significant part to play in the escalation of sectarianism.

Policies of de-Ba'athification that began under Paul Bremer during the US invasion have continued under Maliki’s helm, leaving thousands of Sunnis jobless. Thousands have also been imprisoned without charges being investigated, while many are being kept in prison for indefinite periods based on evidence provided by secret informers under counterterrorism charges. 

Corruption has been endemic as there have been hardly any improvements to state services, despite the Iraqi government generating $100 billion a year from the sale of oil.

The non-violent protests taking place across Iraq have highlighted these very same issues and have also received support from the Shi'ite community, including Muqtadr al-Sadr and his followers.

Despite all this, the protests continue to be denounced by Maliki as a ploy by pro-Ba’athists and other enemies acting as proxies for hostile states; an argument on the basis of which the Iraqi prime minister has continued to either ignore or crush protest camps.

The fighting in Fallujah is a culmination of antigovernment sentiments that Iraqi Sunnis have harbored for a long time. It was only a matter of time until arms would be taken up against government forces. Yet the third battle of Fallujah will go down as another episode of Maliki’s War on Terror. The hundreds of casualties in the fighting will be deemed as collateral damage in a noble attempt to drive out al-Qaeda.

As for the US, the White House continues to watch on with benign neglect. The scenes in Fallujah continue to be parroted across US media as a lamentable tragedy, now that al-Qaeda" has seized the city that American troops put their lives on the line to "liberate."

As Maliki’s rhetoric over fighting al-Qaeda affiliates is gobbled up by the White House, there seems to be no reason to slap his wrist, let alone reign in his entrenched system of anti-Sunni discrimination. Instead, he receives military aid in abundance. Yet this is still supposed to be the "Iraqi people’s fight" and, as always, the world will continue to believe it so.
