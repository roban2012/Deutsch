	End the Slavery Blame-Game

Renowned Harvard Professor Henry "Skip" Gates recently wrote an Editorial Opinion piece entitled "End the Slavery Blame-Game" which was prominently featured in the New York Times. Professor Gates argues that certain African nations and leaders played major roles in capturing Africans and selling them to European slave traffickers. Therefore, from his perspective, Africans were equally complicit in the holocaust of enslavement, thereby nullifying 抵消 any claim for reparations 补偿 for the cultural, mental, spiritual and physical damages inflicted 强加于 on Africans in America. <br><br>

It appears the point of Professor Gates' Op-Ed piece is to silence the demand for reparations once and for all by shifting the burden for enslavement and the subsequent centuries of enforced labor, colonialism and apartheid on to the shoulders of Africans. In short, if Africans had not captured and sold their own people, the trans-Atlantic slave trade and development of the "peculiar institution" would not have transpired （发生）.<br><br>
