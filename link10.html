世界就是我们的学校！（Backpacking/wandern）<br><br>

Freiwilliges soziales Jahr (Voluntary social year), abbr. FSJ, is a state-funded voluntary work program particularly for young adults. It can last between six to eighteen months and also be spent working abroad. Before compulsory military or civilian service was abandoned in Germany, the FSJ could be used as a replacement if the service duration was at least twelve months.<br><br>

1926年9月18日，一艘游轮搭载了504个学生、一名教师和63名行政人员首航成功。<br><br>

1963年香港船王董浩云为SAS无偿提供了豪华的“环球探险家号”游轮。<br><br>

1965年美国加州查普曼大学的正式加入，SAS才被人们所认识和承认。<br><br>

现在，由美国非盈利教育组织Institute of Shipboard Education和美国弗吉尼亚大学联合主办的SAS海上大学，创造性地将大学课程、海外交流和环球旅行科学地融合在一起，一个学期百余日，访问全球10-15个国家和地区，学生将在船上选修4门课程，合格者将获得美国弗吉尼亚大学12学分。在这所船上，集中了美国和世界各地的600名优秀大学生一起航行；有来自全美知名学府的三四十名教授在船上开设20个专业（人文、科学、商业、教育等）75门课程。<br><br>

“海上学府” （Institute for Shipboard Education）由香港董浩云在上世纪70年代创立，各国大学生乘坐董先生捐赠的“环球探险家号”，环航世界，边学习，边考察。由于学费昂贵，中国只有几名学生在上世纪70年代末受到董氏航海基金会的资助，参加了“海上学府”的游学。<br><br>

汕头大学是中国大陆唯一一所参加 “海上学府”环球游学项目的高校。2003年起，美国匹兹堡大学连续10年每年为汕大提供两个名额，参加为期3―4个月的“海上学府”学习。汕头大学商学院2000级学生陈冰琳是第一位“海上学府”的幸运儿。4个月四门课程(International  Business，Writing，Global Study，History)都拿了“A”，获得了美国导师很高的评价。<br><br>

海上学府环球航线怎样走？<br><br>

虽然每一年环球航线略有不同，但均跨越大西洋、印度洋和太平洋，抵达东、西、南、北半球，沿途停靠十多个国家，靠岸时间从一天到一周不等。何洋此次游学将经停12个国家的16个地区，海上航行105天。她将从巴哈马拿骚出发，前往多米尼克罗索、巴西马瑙斯、加纳塔科拉迪及阿克拉、南非开普敦、毛里求斯路易港、印度柯钦、新加坡、越南胡志明市、中国香港及上海、日本神户及横滨、美国夏威夷希罗，最后回到美国加州圣地亚哥。<br><br>

参加这个项目要花多少钱？<br><br>

海上学府项目春、秋两次航行的学费，从2.3万美元到3.1万美元不等。何洋此次虽然申请到2万多美元的奖学金，但由于游轮要经停12个国家，因而她另外准备了折合人民币5万多元的备用金。<br><br>

何洋介绍，申请海上学府项目与申请出国留学的过程类似。近年来，在中国大陆只有复旦大学、汕头大学与海上学府项目有合作交流。若要个人申请，则需通过官方网站，进行全英文入学申请。<br><br>

Students attend classes while the ship is at sea in a variety of subjects and disciplines. These classes are typically humanities classes connecting with one or more of the countries on the itinerary. All students are required to take Global Studies, an interdisciplinary core course; When the ship is in a port, no classes are held. Students are then able to travel on Semester at Sea sponsored trips or independently within the country. However, travel outside the country of port is strictly prohibited, resulting in dismissal from the program.<br><br>

Although the University of Virginia is the academic sponsor for the program, Semester at Sea is open to students from any university. <br><br>

Semester at Sea (SAS) is a study abroad program founded in 1963, now managed by the Institute for Shipboard Education in Charlottesville, Virginia. The University of Virginia is the current academic sponsor for the program while the program itself is run on a cruise ship called the MV Explorer. Throughout the history of the program, nearly 55,000 undergraduate students from more than 1,500 colleges and universities have participated in Semester at Sea.<br><br>

During the spring and fall semesters, the approximately 100-day program circumnavigates the globe, with up to 720 undergraduates traveling from North America heading either east across the Atlantic or west across the Pacific, visiting from 8 to 11 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and South America, before ending the voyage in another North American port. The program previously had voyages that would sail through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal, but due to piracy concerns in the Gulf of Aden, voyages now typically travel around Africa. During the summer months, ISE hosts a shorter 65-day Semester at Sea program that concentrates on one general region of the world. Frequently, summer semester programs visit various ports in East Asia or Europe. In May 2011, Semester at Sea introduced a new short-term or Maymester voyage with a curriculum focused on the UN Millennium Development Goals. These voyages lasted 26 days and offered students the opportunity to earn 4-5 transferable credits. However, following the Maymester 2012 voyage, Semester at Sea made the decision to cancel Short-Term voyages indefinitely due to low enrollment.<br><br>

Additionally, a two-week "Enrichment Voyage" program is held for continuing education participants during December and January. Itineraries for these voyages focus on Central America and South America, often transiting the Panama Canal or traveling up the Amazon River.<br><br>
	
The History of Shipboard Education<br><br>

Nearly 100 years ago, the idea for a floating university that would travel the world became the passionate pursuit of James Edwin Lough, a psychology professor at New York University. He believed changes needed to be made to traditional teaching methods of American universities and soon became a leader in a new educational movement. Travel and first-hand experience, he felt, must be part of every scholar’s education and he set out to find others who shared this vision.<br><br>

The University of Virginia is a public research university in Charlottesville, Virginia, United States. It was conceived and designed by U.S. President Thomas Jefferson, and established in 1819. <br><br>

In the 2013 edition of U.S. News & World Report's National University Rankings, the school was listed as America's 2nd best public university, tied with UCLA and surpassed only by UC Berkeley.<br><br>
<a href= "pic55.html">歌曲：《国际歌》（Die Internationale）</a><br><br>
Semester at Sea was originally named University of the Seven Seas and later World Campus Afloat before gaining its present name in 1977. In December 2005, it was announced that the University of Virginia would begin academic sponsorship of the program in Summer 2006. Previous sponsors include the University of Pittsburgh (1981C2006), the University of Colorado (1977C1980), and Chapman University (1965C1975).<br><br>

The Spring 2012 Voyage<br><br>
This semester’s 570 students disembarked this week in San Diego, heading out towards their futures with an international and interconnected outlook on life. The 108th voyage of Semester at Sea has officially come to an end after 105 days, 12 countries, and 25,000 nautical miles around the world.<br><br>

The MV Explorer pulled away from Nassau in January and headed eastbound to the West Coast, touching 4 continents on the way. Students took classes in anthropology, art history, biology, business, economics, English, geography, history, linguistics, media studies, medicine, music, poetry, political science, religious studies, studio art, writingCand that’s just the courses covered on the blog.<br><br>

From the opera house in Manaus to hip-hop concerts in Cape Town, the tunnels of Viet Nam to the skyscrapers of Hong Kong, non-profits in Cambodia to orphanages in Brazil, grade schools in India to universities in Singapore, soccer in South Africa to cycling in Accra, snorkeling in Dominica, tea ceremonies in Japan, visits from foreign officers and domestic dignitaries, and home stays in India and Ghana, this has truly been, in the words of this semester’s executive dean Dr. Bob Vieira, “an epic voyage.”<br><br>

Gap year<br><br>
间隔年（Gap Year），一般指青年在升学之后开学之前、或者毕业之后工作之前，所做的一次长期旅行。<br><br>
Gap year的起源，就一定得从上世纪六十年代的嬉皮士浪潮说起。当时不约而同前往印度的英国嬉皮士们正是最初意义上的gap year实践者。六十年代的西方社会在政治、经济和文化各方面都经历了前所未有的巨大震荡。反越战示威、美国总统肯尼迪遭暗杀、反种族运动、伦敦的前卫时装风潮…各种新思潮和新事物的冲击促成了the swinging sixties的产生。在这股风潮下，活跃于四、五十时代的“垮掉的一代”开始演变为更加活跃的反主流文化群体DD嬉皮士。他们用公社式的和流浪的生活方式来表达对越战和民族主义的反对，提倡非传统的宗教文化，批评西方国家中产阶级的价值观。典型的嬉皮士之旅一般是从西欧出发，以最便宜的旅行方式穿过欧亚大陆到达亚洲的印度或斯里兰卡。如今鼎鼎大名的背包族旅行指南《Lonely Planet》的创始人Tony Wheeler夫妇就是在这样的旅行之后写出了第一本书《便宜走亚洲》。 嬉皮士hippie之旅自有其精神上的驱动力，一般是“认识自我”，“寻找精神家园”或是“与他人交流”。<br><br>
A gap year is time out to travel between life stages. It is also known as a sabbatical, time off, time out and a year out, referring to a period of time (not necessarily 12 months) in which people disengage from curricular education and/or work and undertake activities such as traveling, volunteering or working abroad.<br><br>

In the field of college applications, a gap-year is a year taken between high school and college. During this gap-year, students engage in extra-academic and non-academic courses, language studies, volunteer work, travel, internships, sports and more, all for the purpose of improving themselves and their resumes before going to college. These academic gap-years are also called Pathways, Prep-Year and Bridge-Year.<br><br>


The practice of taking time out developed in the United Kingdom in the 1960s. During this time, a student might travel, engage in volunteer work overseas or undertake a working holiday abroad.<br><br>

In 1967, Nicholas Maclean-Bristol set up the educational volunteering charity Project Trust and sent three volunteers to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia.<br><br>

In 1973, Graham "Skroo" Turner set up the company Topdeck, one of the first tour operators.<br><br>

In 1978, the Prince of Wales and Colonel John Blashford-Snell began what is now known as Raleigh International by launching Operation Drake, an expedition voyage around the world following Sir Francis Drake's route.<br><br>

In the United States, the deferred year idea was promoted by Cornelius H. Bull, in 1980.<br><br>

In 2010, a deferred year increased among school, college and university leavers, as this is seen as an attractive option for future career development.[3] Conversely, 2011 saw a decline in the number of prospective students from the UK taking gap years due to the competitiveness of courses and the imminent rise in university fees.<br><br>

A year out has grown very popular among students in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. A trend for a year out is to travel, volunteer and working abroad, which may include participating in international education programs that combine language study, homestays, cultural immersion, community service, and independent study.<br><br>

I start with people's growth, my own growth included. Help others get better, that is, help people who work for you grow. If team works, everything will be fine.<br><br>
My ability to lead (leiten/Leiter), to chart the course for the team members, to inspire them to reach for performance, to deliver the values you bring to the job. We focus on the courage to do the right thing. I tend to think about this in terms of helping others get better. I view myself as a value-added facilitator（促进者/帮助着）here more than as someone who's crashing through the waves on the bridge of a frigate护卫舰. It feels great to see the people you work with grow and achieve.<br><br>
It generally gets down to a very personal level - openness to change, courage to change, hard work and teamwork. What I do is figure out how to unlock that in people, because most people have that inside them. But they often get trapped in, for example, fear, bureaucracy or confusion.<br><br>
You chart the course for yourself and the people you work with, to expect a lot and inspire people, to have the right values, to find a way and deliver results - these are pretty fundamental things. The things you expect of people have to be so fundamental. Like a priest missionary (the seminary, The Communication Department （传理系/“仁”即“沟通”/仁者无敌） of Hong Kong Baptist University). I expect a fair amount from people. It makes them so much better. <br><br>
There was no question that there was an expectation in my family, for every member, including my children. I think some of the saddest things in the world are when you don't expect enough from your children. They have to run a higher standard. Yes, it will be a little over focused, a little tough, but that's part of the package or side effects (副作用).
As a child, you're trying to grow and meet expectations. If you focus and insist, you will win at least once. Success and achievement can feed on themselves. It feels good to keep succeeding. It’s positive feedback. Then you have the passion to win. Like addiction or maniac （上瘾/狂热）. <br><br>
Expect a lot, inspire people, ask them to take the values that are important to them at home or at church and bring them to work. <br><br>

美国亚裔面对更大教育竞争压力<br><br>

2014年04月04日<br><br>


于时语专栏<br><br>

4月1日愚人节也是美国传统的大学招生发榜截止日，大学招生成为媒体重要题材。常春藤和其他名校的录取率又创新低：今年哈佛大学录取率只有5.9%，斯丹福大学更牛，创造了全美最低录取率5.07%！被名校录取的幸运儿中，纽约长岛的黑人学生艾宁（Kwasi Enin）居然获得所有八所常春藤大学同时录取，成为美国传媒竞相报道的最新名人。<br><br>

精英报刊如《纽约时报》和《华盛顿邮报》也刊登许多文章，批判大学入学竞争的白热化，哀叹这造成中学生和家长们的极大压力。这些批评抱怨大都来自WASP（白人盎格鲁撒克逊新教徒）家庭，一如他们几年前对《虎妈战歌》代表的亚裔家庭教育的激烈批判，反映了主流白人在教育竞争中日渐落后。<br><br>

“天子重英豪，文章教尔曹。万般皆下品，唯有读书高。”这是中国科举时代的社会哲理，因为只有科举考试才是精英阶层的入场券。可是在后工业化的美国，却出现了全社会的“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”：高等教育成为维持中产阶级地位的关键。<br><br>

经济全球化和高科技自动化之下，美国低教育蓝领中产阶级不断沉沦，大学毕业生相对于中学毕业生的平均收入比例，逼近乃至超过两倍。去年牛津大学学者对美国职场作出一项研究。结论在未来廿年中，美国全部702种职业群体中，将近一半（47%）职位“有高度可能被自动化和机器人取代”！大学教育对社会经济地位的重要性，不言而喻。<br><br>

在教育竞争中，亚裔是个赢家，很大程度上是传统文化因素，特别是极其注重子女教育的华裔，在美国教育费用尤其高等教育费用飞涨趋势下，亚裔的教育优势，也归功于父母不惜工本和自我牺牲作出的教育开支和投入。<br><br>

据2010年美国人口普查，美国成人正规大学毕业生比率不到30%，可是亚裔却超过52%。在决定高端经济收入和进入“上层建筑”机会的精英教育上，亚裔硕士学位比率是12%，高出白人六成；至于博士学位比率，亚裔（3%）超过白人的两倍，是黑人和拉美裔的七倍。教育竞争成功反映到经济收入上，亚裔家庭年收入超过十万美元的百分比是32%，超过白人一半，是黑人和拉美裔的三倍。<br><br>

所以美国的社会竞争，日益集中到“教育战线”。前些时候沸沸扬扬的加州SCA5提案是个典型。这是拉美裔州参议员提出的，他嫌包括著名伯克莱大学的加州大学系统亚裔学生太多，要求提高拉美裔和黑人入学比率。此案已通过州参议院，如果在州众议会也获得通过，将於今年11月公投，恢复1996年取消的加大校园中基于族裔的的平权法案，照顾多收拉美裔和黑人。<br><br>

这一新提案得到民主党的积极支持，却明显是对亚裔教育和经济利益的重大威胁，引起政治参与感淡薄而且倾向民主党的亚裔尤其华裔人口前所未有的政治动员。在亚裔族群全力反对之下，加州议会被迫同意搁置这项提案。<br><br>

这一争议彰显了亚裔和华裔在美国大学招生过程中受到的逆向歧视，在其他同样的条件和学习成绩下，他们进入“重点”大学和名牌大学的机会明显低于其他族裔。今年被八所常春藤大学录取的黑人学生艾宁正是例证。<br><br>

艾宁的SAT“高考”分数是2250分，这在满分2400分“状元”比比皆是的华裔中毫不稀奇。艾宁在一个普通高中647名应届毕业生中只是排名11，而近年来“重点中学”华裔状元（毕业班第一名）”和“榜眼”多如牛毛。除了一些校内荣誉，艾宁并无州一级的奖项，而在全国性竞赛中脱颖而出的亚裔华裔成百上千。这些有全国性荣誉和SAT满分的亚裔，许多仍然被常春藤拒之门外。可是像艾宁那样的黑人学生实在凤毛麟角，而成为常春藤争抢的宝贝。<br><br>

由此联系到美国高校理事会（College Board）在乌克兰危机中宣布的“SAT高考”新一轮改革，从2400满分恢复到早先1600分满分，考试内容也有显著变动。这一改革的表面理由，是增加弱势群体的教育机会，但是行家们都指出改革的实质是降低难度（dumb-down），以此改善穷人和少数民族考生的成绩。这又是对考分突出的亚裔不利的发展。<br><br>

教育竞争超越学校课堂和考试，而进入社会政治领域，是美国亚裔和华裔必须密切关注的趋势。<br><br>

'We’re Not This Alien Group': Chinese Students on Fitting In at U.S. Colleges<br><br>

A series of YouTube videos attempts to explain how foreign students struggle at American schools. 
<br><br>

Lauren Davidson
<br><br>

Nov 1 2013
<br><br>
Four Chinese students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where Chinese enrollment has grown 356 percent in the last decade, have set out to educate their American peers about themselves. They’ve taken to YouTube to explain the social misunderstandings that block many foreign students―particularly those from Asia―from integrating with the slang-speaking, booze-guzzling Americans.<br><br>



International students are flocking to US universities in greater numbers, particularly from Asia, but the cultural barriers are as sturdy as ever. Since 2007, the number of Chinese students in the US has grown by around one-fifth or more each year. In the 2011/2012 academic year, 194,029 students from China were enrolled in higher education in the US―an increase of 23 percent from the year before, according to the Institute of International Education.

<br><br>

 

But they still have a hard time fitting into American culture, and this “adjustment fatigue” can lead to isolation. A recent report showed that one in four Chinese students studying at Ivy League universities drop out before graduation. Many of those who do graduate return to China after university; a third of those who do cited poor social skills as the reason.
<br><br>


 

The most popular video on the students’ YouTube channel, with 40,000-plus views, explains why Chinese students prefer to speak Mandarin instead of English: Aside from the obvious reason―that it’s their native language―Chinese schools teach pupils English to pass tests, not chat conversationally. Words like “peeps,” “chillax,” “fo’ real” and “fo’ sho” don’t make the syllabus, and can make Chinese students feel alienated when talking with Americans.

<br><br>



Other videos discuss “Why Chinese Students Don’t Party,” (they place a higher value on studying, and are “treated like this alien person who doesn’t know how to have fun” in drink-fueled social situations), “Pretty Chinese Women,” (in which American and Chinese male students discuss their differing concepts of beauty), and “Chinese Names,” (whose tricky pronunciation can hinder the forming of friendships).

<br><br>

 

“We’re not this alien ‘other’ group,” Cecilia Miao, one of the channel’s founders, told the Wisconsin State Journal. “We should try to celebrate differences, not ignore it.”<br><br>
