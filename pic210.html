In Hogwarts<br><br>

Dumbledore: I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry? <br><br>

Harry: It's just...you see, sir, I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain....certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me. <br><br>

Dumbledore: I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry...he transferred some of his powers to you......the night he gave you that scar. <br><br>

Harry: Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me? <br><br>

Dumbledore: Not intentionally...but yes. <br><br>

Harry: So the Sorting Hat was right. I should be in Slytherin. <br><br>

Dumbledore: It's true. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness......and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why, then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor? <br><br>

Harry: Because I asked it to. <br><br>

Dumbledore: Exactly, Harry, exactly, which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices. <br><br>
